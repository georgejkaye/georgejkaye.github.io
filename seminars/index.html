        The seminars are listed and advertised on

        can sign up to email announcements for emails, or subscribe to
        <code>.ics</code> calendars for series they are interested in. Formerly,
        talks were hosted on <code>talks@bham</code>, but this was deprecated in
        2024 because it was unmaintained and not compliant with university data
        and security policies. Allegedly people in EPS are looking at making a
        better version; it's up to you how invested you get in this saga.
      </p>

        <em>endorsed</em> by an already endorsed user; the previous seminar
        organiser should be able to do this. If they are otherwise

        admin to this list so you can add and modify talks.

        You should also make sure you can access the
        <a
          href="https://bham.sharepoint.com/:x:/r/sites/TheoryofComputation-Research/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7B1A12E153-21AD-4609-AC89-5A0CFB95AFF4%7D&amp;file=seminars.xlsx"
          >Seminar spreadsheet</a
        >.
      </p>
      <h3>Establish the seminar slot</h3>
      <p>
        The first thing to do when setting up the seminars for a term is to
        establish the slot. Ideally, this would be the same slot as the previous
        term, but teaching commitments may affect this. The timetable should be
        confirmed a few weeks before term starts; if you are not in the loop
        with the procedure you could ask the head of education or other members
        of the theory group.
      </p>
      <p>
        If the slot isn't available, a new one needs to be found! It was decided
        in the theory group meeting in January 2023 that the theory seminar has
        <em>highest priority after teaching</em> for taking a time slot. This
        means that, providing you poll the rest of the group early enough,
        people should make an effort to accommodate the seminar! Even if the
        slot does have to be moved, the first preference is to keep the seminar
        on Fridays.
      </p>
      <p>
        If the slot changes, you should update the <code>Time slot</code> field
        in the
        <a
          href="https://researchseminars.org/edit/seminar/?shortname=TheoryCSBham"
          >Manage seminar series page</a
        >, and should also let whoever manages the
        <a href="mailto:cs-calendar@contacts.bham.ac.uk"
          >cs-calendar@contacts.bham.ac.uk</a
        >
        school calendar know, so they can update it on there.
      </p>
      <h3>Book the rooms</h3>
      <p>
        Once the slot is confirmed, you need to book the rooms. Before you go
        ahead and start booking every single Friday in the term, remember to
        leave a space for at least the theory group meeting. The date of this
        should have been decided at the end of the previous theory group
        meeting, but if you don't know when it is you can ask other members of
        the group and hopefully someone will know.
      </p>
      <p>
        Room bookings within the CS building are done via
        <a href="https://portal.clearooms.com/meeting-rooms">Clearooms</a>,
        which hopefully you should be familiar with. If for some reason you have
        not used Clearooms before, you can login at the
        <a
          href="https://api.clearooms.com/users/sso/9fa563df-48d3-4cd3-b6b3-6853cea99923/login"
          >Single sign on page</a
        >. Barring special cases, the seminar should be held in
        <strong>LG23</strong> in Computer Science, which lives in the
        <strong>Zone D - Lower Ground Floor</strong> category. I tend to make
        the bookings for ten minutes before the seminar starts to ten minutes
        after the scheduled end time. For example, if the talk is
        <strong>11:00 - 11:50</strong> then the room booking should be made for
        <strong>10:50 - 12:00</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Clearooms does not at the time of writing have capability for making
        recurring bookings, so you will need to make them one by one. Have fun!
      </p>
      <h4>When LG23 isn't available</h4>
      <p>
        Sometimes you may be asked to move a room booking because the school
        wants to have interviews in LG23, or perhaps someone was even more on
        the ball than you and the room is already booked! After grumbling about
        this for a bit you can instead turn to the
        <a href="https://bhamtimetables.bham.ac.uk/2324Prod/ADlogin.html"
          >Central university room booking portal</a
        >
        to book a room on campus; a room with 30+ capacity should be fine. The
        Old Gym is a tried-and-tested theory favourite, and the Murray Learning
        Centre is close by but the rooms aren't as nice. Usually central rooms
        will only be bookable for hour slots, but since you will mostly be
        working around lectures, the previous occupants should be done at around
        ten minutes before the hour anyway.
      </p>
      <p>
        Only staff members can use the room booking site, but if you are a PhD
        student who also TAs you can use your staff account. If you can't login
        to the system you can always ask someone more familiar with it!
      </p>
      <p>
        <em
          >(I currently can't provide any guidance on how to use it because I
          myself can't access it. However, I'll get a staff account soon so I
          can add some pictures.)</em
        >
      </p>
      <h3>Solicit speaker suggestions</h3>
      <p>
        Send out an email to the Theory mailing list and put a message on the
        Discord asking for people to suggest speakers. As these drip in, you can
        add them to the <em>Speaker suggestions</em> sheet of the seminar
        spreadsheet, which may already contain overflow speakers from previous
        terms.
      </p>
      <h4>Who we should invite</h4>
      <p>
        Ideally, any potential speaker should be 'relatively' local: they should
        be able to get to Birmingham by train in a few hours. This is because we
        can <em>definitely</em> reimburse train travel in the UK.
      </p>
      <p>
        If someone is from further away (e.g. Scotland) then they are likely to
        require a hotel overnight. This <em>is</em> possible and we have done it
        several times before, but be sure to check this with the Theory Theme
        Lead first before you invite anyone.
      </p>
      <p>
        If a host has the funding to host someone from further afield for a
        couple of days, they are of course welcome to do so!
      </p>
      <h3>Advertise <code>researchseminars.org</code> functionality</h3>
      <p>
        It is good to periodically advertise the functionality
        <code>researchseminars.org</code> offers for keeping up to date with the
        seminars. Users can select 'favourite seminars' and add the list to
        their calendar.
      </p>
      <h2>Arranging specific seminar slots</h2>
      <p>
        Now it is time to fill the individual seminar slots! Of course, you can
        go about this however you like but I find the following procedure works
        quite nicely.
      </p>
      <h3>Negotiate with the host</h3>
      <p>
        When you have some speaker suggestions, send some emails to the
        prospective hosts offering them <em>one</em> slot from the schedule,
        preferably starting with thei earliest available. If they can't do this
        one, keep offering until you are both satisfied. This prevents the
        deadlock of having all the slots 'pending' with nobody replying to you!
      </p>
      <p>
        Make sure the host is aware of their responsibilities to not only
        <em>host</em> the speaker but also to <em>chair</em> the talk. It is
        also the responsibility of the speaker to organise a social event for
        the speaker if one is desired, unless they ask you very nicely and you
        are feeling benevolent.
      </p>
      <h3>Make contact with the speaker</h3>
      <p>
        Once you are set on a slot, give the host the go-ahead to invite their
        speaker, ideally with you in cc. Speakers are more likely to respond to
        their friends and collaborators! Make sure the host lets the speaker
        know we can reimburse their train travel, meals on the day, and a hotel
        if appropriate, and that the seminar is
        <strong>50 minutes plus questions</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once this email has been sent, put the potential speaker on the
        spreadsheet with the 'Offered' tag.
      </p>
      <p>
        <img
          src="/images/seminars/offered.webp"
          alt="A row of the theory seminar spreadsheet, filled in with 'George Kaye', 'University of Birmingham', 'g.j.kaye@pgr.bham.ac.uk', 'George' and 'Offered' highlighted in yellow"
        />
      </p>
      <h3>Negotiate with the speaker</h3>
      <p>
        If all goes well, the potential speaker will reply quickly, and will be
        free for their allocated slot! If not, deallocate the current slot and
        choose another currently free one, making sure both host and speaker can
        make it. Eventually, you should find a slot that works. Once everyone is
        happy, change the tag in the spreadsheet to the 'Confirmed' tag.
      </p>
      <p>
        <img
          src="/images/seminars/confirmed.webp"
          alt="A row of the theory seminar spreadsheet, filled in with 'George Kaye', 'University of Birmingham', 'g.j.kaye@pgr.bham.ac.uk', 'George' and 'Confirmed' highlighted in green"
        />
      </p>
      <p>
        By default, the seminar should be delivered
        <strong>using slides</strong>, as this is the easiest way to keep the
        seminar hybrid. If the speaker would like to do a whiteboard,
        <strong
          >it is crucial that you, the organisers, are informed as soon as
          possible</strong
        >
        so that you can make alternative arrangements. At the time of writing
        LG23 does not have very good whiteboard capture; in the past we have
        remedied this by booking out
        <a
          href="https://intranet.birmingham.ac.uk/as/libraryservices/lrat/technical-advice/rooms-equipped-with-panopto-plus.aspx"
          >a room in the University with whiteboard capture</a
        >
        so this can be streamed online. The School also has an
        <a href="https://owllabs.com/products/meeting-owl-3">Owl camera</a>
        which may come in useful; ask someone in Operations about this if you
        want to use it.

      <h3>Add speaker to <code>researchseminars.org</code></h3>
      <p>
        At this point you should add the speaker's details to the seminar
        schedule. This can be done by clicking the 'Manage' tab at the top of
        the <code>researchseminars.org</code> site, and clicking
        <code>schedule</code> in the relevant seminar row.

        />
      </p>
      <p>It is then straightforward to put the details in the right slot.</p>

      <h3>Upgrade the talk to the departmental series <em>(optional)</em></h3>
      <p>
        The CS department has a departmental seminar series, aptly named the
        Computer Science Seminar Series; some of these talks are even toted as
        'Distinguished Seminars'. These seminars are usually followed by
        refreshments or a buffet lunch in the atrium.
      </p>
      <p>
        If a host feels that their speaker will appeal to a wider audience than
        just the theory seminar, they can get in touch with the organisers to
        'upgrade' the talk. To do they can email Research Support at
        <a href="mailto:cs-researchsupport@contacts.bham.ac.uk"
          >cs-researchsupport@contacts.bham.ac.uk</a
        >, ideally with you in cc to coordinate. If the CS series organisers
        agree to host the seminar,
        <em
          >responsibility of organising the seminar transfers to them unless
          otherwise specified</em
        >. Make sure this is well-established!
      </p>
      <p>
        I have previously received communication from the CS seminar organising
        committee because they have become overwhelmed by requests for speakers
        in their series, so they can't afford all the refreshments needed. So
        make sure you ask politely :)
      </p>
      <h3>Book the speaker a hotel <em>(where appropriate)</em></h3>
      <p>
        If the speaker will be staying overnight, it is cordial to book them a
        hotel room so that they aren't as much out of pocket. Since January
        2024, the Theory Group are responsible for managing their own budget, so
        you should get in touch with the Theme Lead to okay the request. Once
        they've given it the thumbs up, you can get the hotel booked by sending
        an email to Research Support at
        <a href="mailto:cs-researchsupport@contacts.bham.ac.uk"
          >cs-researchsupport@contacts.bham.ac.uk</a
        >. Research Support will contact the speaker to confirm their details
        and the hotel room will be booked.
      </p>
      <h3>Get title and abstract</h3>
      <p>
        The start of the week before the talk, you should make contact with the
        speaker again for their title and abstract. I also like to request the
        speaker sends across their slides, making it less stressful to set up in
        advance, and to remind them that the seminar is 50 minutes plus
        questions. This can also flag up any miscommunication in which the
        speaker thinks they are giving a whiteboard talk and they or the host
        haven't told you.
      </p>
      <p>
        You should cc in the host into this email and let the speaker know that
        the host will be greeting and entertaining them once they arrive. You
        can also subtly remind the host to bring the speaker to the room ten
        minutes before the talk begins!
      </p>
      <h3>Announce the talk</h3>
      <p>
        The week of the talk, you should announce the talk both on the theory
        mailing list and on Discord. In the email you should include the title,
        abstract and Zoom details; in the Discord message I tend just to link to
        the talk page to avoid cluttering the channel.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you're interested, I have
        <a href="https://github.com/georgejkaye/talks-bot"
          >a script to generate the emails and the Discord messages</a
        >.
      </p>
      <h3>Set up seminar room</h3>
      <p>On the day of the seminar, your only job is to set up the room!</p>
      <h4>Seating</h4>
      <p>
        These days it's good to set up at least 25 seats since we're a large
        group now! Depending on how the room is when you arrive it might be
        preferable for some of the rows to also have tables, but that's up to
        you.
      </p>
      <h4>Zoom</h4>
      <p>
        You need to set up the computer in the room and join the theory seminar
        zoom call. I already have
        <a href="https://georgejkaye.com/lg23">a guide on how to set up LG23</a>
        which you might find useful since LG23 is a bit non-standard. Other
        rooms in the university are a bit more straightforward.
      </p>
      <p>Make sure the online participants (if there are any) can hear you!</p>
      <h4>Slides</h4>
      <p>
        You will also need to get the slides up on the screen. Once they are,
        ensure that the speaker can actually change slides by flicking through
        them a little.
      </p>
      <h4>Chairing</h4>
      <p>
        Once you are ready to go, the host can begin their chairing duties. Even
        though you are now relinquished of responsibility, I find it's often
        good to be sitting somewhere you can get to the front fairly easily in
        case there's technical issues.
      </p>
      <h3>Reimburse speaker</h3>
      <p>
        After the seminar, the last thing to do is to contact the speaker with
        details on how to claim their expenses. If they are being funded by
        another member of the group, you of course do not need to worry about
        this.
      </p>
      <p>
        The speaker will need to fill out the intimidating-looking
        <a
          href="https://intranet.birmingham.ac.uk/finance/transaction-services/pay-you/expenses/non-staff-expenses.aspx"
          >non-staff expenses form</a
        >. Their expenses need to go in the top half of the form, i.e.
        <em>not</em> the section labelled 'For project use only'. The
        appropriate codes can be found in the seminar spreadsheet. It is nice to
        pre-fill out a row to show the speaker how it is done; I've put some
        dummy codes in below just in case someone tries to spend all the Theory
        budget on a night at Snobs.
      </p>
      <p>
        <img
          src="/images/seminars/claim.webp"
          alt="The first claims section of the non-staff expenses form, filled out with 'Trains - Cambridge to Birmingham' and 'Lunch at Staff House' along with some dummy values for 'Company', 'Analysis', 'Cost Centre', 'Activity', 'Source of Funds' and 'Amount'"
        />
      </p>
      <p>
        Once the speaker has filled out the form, they should send it to the
        Theory Theme Lead with you and
        <a href="mailto:cs-researchsupport@contacts.bham.ac.uk"
          >cs-researchsupport@contacts.bham.ac.uk</a
        >
        in cc. With any luck, the claim will be processed quickly and the
        speaker will get their money back in a few weeks. (At the time of
        writing, Research Support are <em>very</em> efficient; this may have
        changed by the time you are reading this!)
