Hello! I'm George, a PhD student researcher at the University of Birmingham, under the supervision of [Dan Ghica](https://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~drg/) and [Miriam Backens](https://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~backensm/)!

I am a member of the [Theory Group](https://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/groupings/theory/).

## About me

I play the piano, enjoy train journeys and walks down canals, and (unfortunately) support Arsenal.

I'm also currently School of Computer Science [Cookie Break](https://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/internal/research_students/cookiebreaks/) admin!

I occasionally take photos of pretty things and put them on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/georgejkaye/).

Here are some [pictures](/pictures) of me!

## Interests

* Programming languages
* The lambda calculus
* Diagrams
* Compilers
* Reasoning

## Current work

Currently my work involves defining hypergraphs and showing that these hypergraphs can be used to model a traced symmetric monoidal category. Eventually this will lead to developing a sound and complete diagrammatic semantics for digital circuits.

## Projects

**Diagrammatic semantics for digital circuits** \[[Visualiser](\circuits\visualiser)\] \[[Very basic talk](\pages\circuits\Diagrammatic semantics for digital circuits.pdf)\]  
*Defining an operational semantics for digital circuits using hypergraphs.*

**A visualiser for linear lambda-terms as rooted 3-valent maps** \[[Page](\lambda-visualiser)\]  
*A set of tools for the representation of lambda terms as their corresponding rooted maps. Developed for my MSci final year project under the supervision of [Noam Zeilberger](http://noamz.org/).*

## Talks
