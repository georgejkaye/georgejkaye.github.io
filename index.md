Hello! I'm George, a PhD student researcher at the University of Birmingham, under the supervision of [Dan Ghica](http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~drg/)!

## About me

I play the piano, enjoy train journeys and walks down canals, and (unfortunately) support Arsenal.

I'm also currently School of Computer Science [Cookie Break](https://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/internal/research_students/cookiebreaks/) admin!

I occasionally take photos of pretty things and put them on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/georgejkaye/).

Here are some [pictures](/pictures) of me!

### Interests

* Programming languages
* The lambda calculus
* Compilers
* Reasoning

### Current work

Currently my work involves defining hypergraphs and showing that these hypergraphs can be used to model a traced symmetric monoidal category. Eventually this will lead to developing a sound and complete diagrammatic semantics for digital circuits.

### Contact me

**Personal:** georgejkaye at gmail.com

**University:** g.j.kaye at cs.bham.ac.uk

**Where to find me:** ~~Office 244 (Desk J), School of Computer Science, University of Birmingham~~ My house, under lockdown!
