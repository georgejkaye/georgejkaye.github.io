## 07/10: Starter for Ten
![Starter for Ten](/images/screenings/starter-for-ten/1.jpg){:class="post-img"}
One of the first films that Vanessa recommended to me, featuring a very young James McAvoy, a very young Benedict Cumberbatch and University Challenge. Kickstarted the Sunday Screenings in style.

## 14/10: Baby Driver
![Baby Driver](/images/screenings/baby-driver/1.jpg){:class="post-img"}
One of Alex's favourite films, this is an action-packed car caper with some good tunes to boot. Plus it has Lily James in it, which might be why Alex likes it so much.

## 21/10: Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason
![Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason](/images/screenings/bridget-jones-the-edge-of-reason/1.jpg){:class="post-img"}
The bÃªte noire of the *Bridget Jones* trilogy (and a film I've seen!), we have to watch this one because we need to see Bridget Jones' Baby at some point as well and we're not skippers!

## 28/10: A Knight's Tale
![A Knight's Tale](/images/screenings/a-knights-tale/1.jpg){:class="post-img"}
This film has a naked Paul Bettany in it.

## 31/10: The Silence of the Lambs
![The Silence of the Lambs](/images/screenings/the-silence-of-the-lambs/1.jpg){:class="post-img"}

A very famous film! A psyschological horror with Tallulah from Bugsy Malone and everyone's favourite psychopath, Hannibal Lecter.

## 04/11: The Nightmare Before Christmas
![The Nightmare Before Christmas](/images/screenings/the-nightmare-before-christmas/1.jpg){:class="post-img"}

A true classic (and a film I've seen!) to conclude the Halloween screenings, and also to set up a nice segue into Christmas scheduling! Christmas of course does not actually start until December 1st.

[Top](#top)

## 11/11: Hot Fuzz
![Hot Fuzz](/images/screenings/hot-fuzz/1.jpg){:class="post-img"}

Another well-loved Edgar Wright romp (and a film I've seen!). I aptly ate an Aldi knockoff Cornetto before watching this, but I think it was the wrong flavour.

## 18/11: I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here! Series 18 Premiere
![I'm A Celebrity: Get Me Out of Here... Series 18 Premiere](/images/screenings/im-a-celeb/1.jpg){:class="post-img"}

This isn't a film! But it has Anne Hegerty in it so I'm willing to let it slide.

## 25/11: Coco
![Coco](/images/screenings/coco/1.jpg){:class="post-img"}

Watching this is apparently the closest Ash has ever come to crying during a film. That doesn't really bode well for the rest of us...

## 01/12: Love Actually
![Love Actually](/images/screenings/love-actually/1.jpg){:class="post-img"}
The best Christmas film is the only choice for the first festive screening!

## 02/12: Arthur Christmas
![Arthur Christmas](/images/screenings/arthur-christmas/1.jpg){:class="post-img"}
Another excellent Christmas film that makes me a bit weepy from time to time.

## 09/12: Gremlins
![Gremlins](/images/screenings/gremlins/1.jpg){:class="post-img"}
Alex's chosen Christmas film is another cult classic (but one I haven't watched before!)

## 13/01: Kingsman
![Kingsman](/images/screenings/kingsman/1.jpg){:class="post-img"}
We begin the new year in style with this smooth spy flick.

## 20/01: Sing Street
![Sing Street](/images/screenings/sing-street/1.jpg){:class="post-img"}
A rare Ed suggestion since we had literally no other ideas, but this film has plenty of bangers so that's alright.

## 27/01: Spy Kids 2
![Spy Kids 2](/images/screenings/spy-kids-2/1.jpg){:class="post-img"}
One of the greatest spy films ever made gets a sequel, it's even more bizarro but with less Alan Cumming.

## 03/02: Singh is Kinng
![Singh is Kinng](/images/screenings/singh-is-kinng/1.jpg){:class="post-img"}
Ash gets us to watch a Bollywood film and it's actually pretty good!

## 10/02: Scooby-Doo
![Scooby-Doo](/images/screenings/scooby-doo/1.jpg){:class="post-img"}
After a spike of Shaggy memes, I make everyone watch the Scooby-Doo film. Everyone enjoys it so much that we watch the second one afterwards!

## 17/02: Ex Machina
![Ex Machina](/images/screenings/ex-machina/1.jpg){:class="post-img"}
Ed dives into the mix with this edgy film about artificial intelligence, but they're sexy robots!

## 24/02: Back to the Future
![Back to the Future](/images/screenings/back-to-the-future/1.jpg){:class="post-img"}
I am once again overruled and we watch this very important film.

## 03/03: Slumdog Millionaire
![Slumdog Millionaire](/images/screenings/slumdog-millionaire/1.jpg){:class="post-img"}
It's another game show film!

## 10/03: Princess Diaries
![Princess Diaries](/images/screenings/princess-diaries/1.jpg){:class="post-img"}
There was a reason behind this choice but I forgot what it was. We also watched the second one and ordered KFC that went on a magical mystery tour of Selly!

## 17/03: Twilight
![Twilight](/images/screenings/twilight/1.jpg){:class="post-img"}
I randomly choose a film and am baffled when people actually want to watch it. We watched New Moon too! (And then everyone watched the first 30 minutes of Eclipse without me and I complained for hours)

## 24/03: The Wolf of Wall Street
![The Wolf of Wall Street](/images/screenings/the-wolf-of-wall-street/1.jpg){:class="post-img"}
Alex wanted to watch Ferris Bueller but he was overruled (it's not just me!) and we watched this film instead! It's an experience.
