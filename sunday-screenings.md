## 07/10: Starter for Ten
![Starter for Ten](/images/screenings/starter-for-ten/1.jpg){:class="post-img"}
One of the first films that Vanessa recommended to me, featuring a very young James McAvoy, a very young Benedict Cumberbatch and University Challenge. Kickstarted the Sunday Screenings in style.

## 14/10: Baby Driver

One of Alex's favourite films, this is an action-packed car caper with some good tunes to boot. Plus it has Lily James in it, which might be why Alex likes it so much.

## 21/10: Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason
![Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason](/images/screenings/bridget-jones-the-edge-of-reason/1.jpg){:class="post-img"}
The bÃªte noire of the *Bridget Jones* trilogy (and a film I've seen!), we have to watch this one because we need to see Bridget Jones' Baby at some point as well and we're not skippers!

## 28/10: A Knight's Tale

This film has a naked Paul Bettany in it.

## 31/10: The Silence of the Lambs
![The Silence of the Lambs](/images/screenings/the-silence-of-the-lambs/1.jpg){:class="post-img"}

A very famous film! A psyschological horror with Tallulah from Bugsy Malone and everyone's favourite psychopath, Hannibal Lecter.

## 04/11: The Nightmare Before Christmas
![The Nightmare Before Christmas](/images/screenings/the-nightmare-before-christmas/1.jpg){:class="post-img"}

A true classic (and a film I've seen!) to conclude the Halloween screenings, and also to set up a nice segue into Christmas scheduling! Christmas of course does not actually start until December 1st.
