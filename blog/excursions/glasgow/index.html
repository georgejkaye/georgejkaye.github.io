          I stumbled across some cheap advance tickets to Carlisle but strikes

        <p>
          One evening while engaging in some 'light' drinking with friends, I
          decided to check out some train fares (this is not deviant behaviour).
          To my surprise, I found that you could get to Carlisle via the
          legendary
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Settle%E2%80%93Carlisle_line"
            >Settle-Carlisle line</a
          >
          and back again for the low low price of Â£29! Eager to experience this
          important train pilgrimage, I snapped up the tickets and looked
          forwards to ticking some more stations off my list! Alas, all would
          not be so straightforward.
        </p>
        <p>
          A couple of days later, I discovered to my horror that Northern didn't
          actually run that many trains on Saturdays (something to do with a
          strike). This threw all my plans into turmoil - rail replacement buses
          wouldn't do! So I came up with a cunning plan and exploited ticket
          acceptance and my own hard-earned money to extend my trip up to
          Glasgow instead. This seemed like the most logical course of action to
          take.
        </p>
        <p>
          Soon the day rolled around and I awoke in the wee hours of the
          morning, eager to begin my adventure. But there was already turmoil -
          Storm Erik had blocked all the lines between Carstairs and Motherwell!
          But I had faith that by the time I made it to Scotland all would be
          fixed, so I set off unperturbed. For some time I was the only one in
          the carriage so attempted to take some comedy selfies - these were all
          unfit for public consumption.
        </p>
        <p>
          <img
            src="/images/excursions/glasgow/1.jpg"
            alt="A quiet quiet carriage"
          />
          <em>My surprisingly quiet quiet carriage</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          At first the journey seemed like it would pass smoothly - we were
          storming up the West Coast Main Line with no cause for concern. I even
          spotted the Virgin trainbow at Stafford, surely a good luck omen. One
          thing preyed on my mind though - would we be able to make it through
          Carstairs? Some trains were cancelled, some not - it seemed not even
          National Rail knew what was really going on. But I remained optimistic
          as we rolled into Preston. We then did not move from Preston for quite
          some time. What was going on?
        </p>
        <p>
          It turned out our train didn't have a driver! This was problematic as
          trains tend to need drivers. I was ready to volunteer using my hours
          of Train Simulator experience but one turned up and we were soon on
          the move again. But disaster struck once again! A tree was blocking
          the line, no doubt thanks to the dastardly Storm Erik. There was no
          way through and all we could do was sit tight until they got it off
          the tracks.
        </p>
        <p>
          <img
            src="/images/excursions/glasgow/2.jpg"
            alt="It was all going so well"
          />
          <em>It was all going so well</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          Eventually we were on the move again, and trundled into Lancaster 58
          minutes late (a figure I would later round up to 60 minutes in my
          Delay Repay claim). This was where my seat reservation ended, so I got
          quite worried that I might lose my precious window seat! The little
          screen said someone might be coming on at Oxenholme Lake District, so
          I mentally prepared myself for the disappointment.
        </p>
        <p>
          When we got to Oxenholme, someone did make moves towards my seat (and
          I even offered it to them!) but there was a stroke of luck - she was
          too awkward to sit there! I retained the window seat, which was just
          as well because the scenery was very nice.
        </p>

          />
          <em>The journey was very scenic</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          The rest of my journey passed without much incident, although we still
          arrived into Glasgow 30 minutes late. But that was fine because I'd be
          able to claim back all the money for the train tickets! My first port
          of call at Glasgow Central was of course Burger King - I'd now eaten
          there at both ends of the West Coast Main Line!
        </p>
        <p>
          <img src="/images/excursions/glasgow/4.jpg" alt="Glasgow Central!" />
          <em>Glasgow Central!</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          I started my exploration with a wander around the city centre. I found
          the statue with a cone on his head, and also checked out Glasgow Queen
          Street, although it was currently under heavy refurbishment so its
          true majesty was concealed. Where to next?
        </p>
        <p>
          Eager to check out the Glasgow Subway, I purchased myself a day ticket
          and hopped aboard. I decided to check out Kelvingrove Park to satisfy
          my urge for a nice walk. It was very big and green, and since the sun
          was shining everything looked very pretty!
        </p>
        <p>
          <img
            src="/images/excursions/glasgow/5.jpg"
            alt="What's that in the distance?"
          />
          <em>What's that in the distance?</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          There was a very grand building overlooking the park and I wandered
          over to check it out. It turned out this was part of the University of
          Glasgow! While it wasn't a big clock, it was still a very impressive
          building and definitely worth a visit. I spent a long time trying to
          locate the Computer Science building, which was harder to find than I
          anticipated. Eventually after going completely the wrong way I
          stumbled across it, although I wasn't sure if I was allowed in so I
          didn't bother. They had posters about my beloved Haskell though so
          that's a definite plus!
        </p>
        <p>
          Another nearby attraction was the Glasgow Botanical Gardens, so I made
          for them. On the way I found the two W's in my life: Waitrose and
          Waterstones. I finally gave into temptation and purchased a copy of
          <em>The ABC Murders</em>, encouraged by the recent BBC adaptation
          starring John Malkovich. I also scouted out the Waitrose and found it
          to be very similar to most Waitroses I had been in, which wasn't
          entirely unexpected.
        </p>
        <p>
          There was much more to the Botanical Gardens than I expected, and I
          spent a good 45 minutes looking at all the exotic plants and trying
          not to hit anything or anyone with my backpack. There was all sorts to
          see, from huge trees to lots of trendy cacti.
        </p>

          <em>Look at all these plants!</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          It was beginning to get dark so I headed back for the centre again. I
          walked around the station and crossed several bridges that I had seen
          on my way in. It was at this moment that I decided to check how the
          trains were getting on after the earlier shambles. After laughing at
          people on the cancelled train I discovered to my horror that I was
          also one of these people. But not to worry since there was another
          train 40 minutes later, and I might as well flex my Delay Repay
          muscles once more.
        </p>

          <em>The city centre as the sun comes down</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          I popped into Sainsbury's to get myself a meal deal and a bag of
          peanut M&amp;M's, then sat down waiting for my train to be announced.
          I realised that it had been sitting at the platform this whole time
          and I could be there instead, so I made my way across and sat in
          exactly the same seat I had been in on the way up! Soon we were on our
          way and four hours later I was walking through New Street to Platform
          12B, where there was another long wait for my train to Selly.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I got home there was lots of pizza in my kitchen! I asked if I
          could have any. I could not.
