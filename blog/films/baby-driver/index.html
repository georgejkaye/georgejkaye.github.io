          Baby Driver on the recommendation of my trusty housemate Alex. Is it
          just Fast & Furious - The Musical, or is it actually a bit more
          sophisticated than that?

          Apparently there's a large selection of 'important' films that I
          haven't seen, and
          <a href="http://obsidianeagle.github.io">Alex</a> has taken upon the
          mammoth task of compiling a list of these films with the intention of
          forcing me to watch them. One of the top ones on the list is Baby
          Driver, a film by the guy that did Hot Fuzz (a film I've seen!). As
          cars are the natural enemy of trains I was initially hesitant to watch
          this blasphemy but I relented and we all sat down in my living room to
          enjoy the film (accompanied by several
          <a href="/tea">cups of tea</a>).
        </p>
        <p>
          Instantly there was chaos. Unlike my fault-free screening of the
          enjoyable Starter for Ten last week, Alex's laptop didn't want to send
          audio through his HDMI cable to the television. This was soon hackily
          solved with an aux cable and the screening could begin!
        </p>

        <p>
          Baby Driver's main character is the titular Baby Driver, a young man
          with a tragic past which means he has to listen to music all the time
          while driving. This means there are lots of good songs to listen to,
          although I didn't really know many of them. But it goes really well
          with the slick car action that fills many of the film's scenes, and
          despite the lack of locomotion I was very impressed with what I saw.
        </p>

          <img src="/images/screenings/baby-driver/3.jpg" alt="Lily James" />
          <em
            >Donna makes a cameo in a rare pre-Here We Go Again! appearance.</em
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          Lily James (one of Alex's favourite actresses) plays the love interest
          and this has led me to believe that Baby Driver and Mamma Mia! share
          the same universe - Baby Driver clearly taking place in between Donna
          leaving for her travels and her arriving in Greece. This means that
          Baby is definitely in contention for being Sophie's dad, and I'm
          interested to see how this will be explored in the future. Another
          (perhaps more important) observation to make is that this is the
          second film in a row I've seen to feature a Mamma Mia! actor (Starter
          for Ten of course featuring the very pretty Dominic Cooper) - could
          this be a theme of the Sunday Screenings?
        </p>
        <p>
          The film builds up to a thrilling climax at the end involving a post
          office and lots more drifting (and some newly-developed parkour
          skills), which leads to a very satisfying showdown in a multi-storey
          car park. No train station scenes, but I'd imagine they're saving
          those for Baby Driver 2.
        </p>
        <p>
          Overall Baby Driver was 'quite good' and definitely a worthy use of my
          Sunday evening. Alex promptly tried to get some of the songs from the
          film into EVERY SONG IS A BANGER, and I haven't decided whether I'll
          cave yet (probably not).
