        <p>
          Some time had passed since I had last visited Stirchley Morries, and
          it had almost left my mind completely. Term had resumed and our
          peaceful schedules of endless research had been shattered by the need
          to teach fresh-faced undergraduates about induction and the sequent
          calculus.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, something even more (intentionally) disruptive was now
          occurring. The <a href="https://www.ucu.org.uk/">UCU</a> were striking
          at the start of December over
          <a
            href="https://www.ucu.org.uk/article/11896/Why-were-taking-action#uss"
            >pensions</a
          >,
          <a
            href="https://www.ucu.org.uk/article/11896/Why-were-taking-action#ff"
            >falling pay, the gender and ethnic pay gap, precarious employment
            practices, and unsafe workloads</a
          >. As noble fellows who agreed with their sentiments, Todd and I had
          elected not to go onto campus so as not to break the picket line. We
          joked that we should go and get a ridiculously large amount of mince
          pies and deliver them around the picket lines to show our support.
          Then we realised that this was a fantastic idea and we should do it.
          And while we were we might as well go back to get another Morries
          brekkie.
        </p>
        <p>
          After the avocado-related shambles of our last attempt, I thought I
          might shake things up a bit and get an omelette instead. During my
          youth I often consumed cheese and mushroom omelettes from the
          <a href="https://my.morrisons.com/storefinder/348"
            >Morries in Chippenham</a
          >: you would get a whopping two omelettes <em>and</em> beans
          <em>and</em> chips, making this an exceptionally substantial meal. I
          looked forward to reliving the only happiness I had ever experienced
          as a child.
        </p>
        <p>
          <img
            src="/images/adventures/007/morries.webp"
            alt="A picture of Morrisons Chippenham: the front of the store has a vaulted roof with a glass frontage, the words MORRISONS in yellow on the front."
          />
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>The Morries in Chippenham, which we were not visiting today.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          Unfortunately, my dreams were instantly dashed and thrown into a
          particularly large bin from which there was no return, as there was no
          mention of omelettes on the menu. I made a loud comment about this to
          Todd and a man sitting nearby said I should just ask them to make me
          one. I nearly choked as I looked at this man of immense power who I
          had never met before talking to me, and I made an awkward smile and
          walked away before he could try and interact with me further.
        </p>
        <p>
          Instead, I had a much better idea. Instead of substituting the entire
          breakfast for a meal that didn't exist, I would just ask them to
          substitute the avocado for another hash brown. That such a simple
          solution was so effective shook me, and for a second I understood what
          it was like to be a reviewer telling me that my work was too simple to
          be published.
        </p>
        <p>
          We joined the queue and then another spanner was thrown in the works.
          There was a sign saying that they were doing a deal where you could
          get a main meal for Â£5. Despite this being more than our brekkies
          would cost, Todd and I were immediately sucked into the chance of
          saving hypothetical money, and we left the queue to return back to
          inspect the menu and see what counted as a main in today's
          avocado-laden world. It turned out that none of the mains were really
          that appetising though, and getting a brekkie was clearly the best
          option. So in the end we didn't save any money, despite morally saving
          money by not opting for the more expensive meal that we would have
          saved money on. We returned to the queue once more: in the time that
          we had spent achieving nothing, it had not moved.
        </p>
        <p>
          After some time, as Morries don't employ enough people in their
          kitchens, we reached the till and ordered. Having learned from our
          mistakes last time, we already had a table in mind and when the lady
          asked I pointed to it confidently. My cool composure was then
          destroyed instantly when she asked 'are you sure you want that one?'.
          I was thrown into confusion as I wondered why she would say this. Was
          something wrong with the table? Or was it just because she saw Todd
          was sitting there and she thought I would rather spend my meal with
          better company? Although this last statement was true, I doubted it
          was what the lady meant. After thinking about this for some time, I
          said 'yes', and the transaction continued.
        </p>
        <p>
          I ordered my tea, but I stumbled over my words and then the lady said
          something and I didn't hear what she said. Rather than asking her to
          clarify what she had said, I used my initiative and just took a cup
          from the crate of cups anyway. I'm not sure if I actually got charged
          for this tea as upon close inspection of the receipt I couldn't see
          it. Maybe it just gets included in the cost of the brekkie. Seconds
          later more confusion occurred as I could not find any milk next to the
          tea machine. I didn't want to immediately go back to the lady to ask
          her where it was, so I went to the table. And lo and behold, the
          previous occupants of the table had left us some milk! This was truly
          a one-of-a-kind brekkie of wonders.
        </p>
        <p>
          As I sat down I realised to my horror that in my haste to obtain milk
          I had forgotten to get the other crucial component of any brekkie:
          salt. I considered getting up and going to get some, but this seemed
          like a lot of needless effort. I was still pondering the problem when
          someone came and brought us our meals: seizing the opportunity
          instantly, I asked politely if we could have some salt, and it was
          delivered to us post-haste. Once again, I had beaten the system.
        </p>
        <p>
          Soon our brekkies were finished, and we set into the store proper in
          order to locate suitable mince pies. To be as inclusive as possible,
          we had decided that we would get vegan mince pies, which are actually
          very common these days: we have clearly progressed as a society! As
          soon as we walked into the fruit and veg section we observed some
          mince pies on a plinth, and made a beeline for them. But these were
          only lattice mince pies, a poor imitation of true mince pies, so we
          did not give them much attention.
        </p>
        <p>
          The true mince pies could be found at the back of the store, concealed
          from casual customers. Luckily Todd and I are anything but, so we
          located them fairly quickly. There was an interesting assortment of
          baked goods, but we were distraught to find that none of them were
          actually vegan. Surely Morries had not missed this golden opportunity
          to make money off the vegans? Unperturbed, I extracted my phone and
          navigated to the Morries website, intent on discovering which of their
          products were suitable for vegans. I was astonished to find that
          Morries did in fact sell vegan mince pies, and they were none other
          than the lattice mince pies we had dismissed so casually earlier! We
          had been taken for fools!
        </p>
        <p>
          We quickly returned to the plinth at the front of the store.
          Fortunately for us, our earlier fallacy had not come back to bite us,
          as there were still plenty of boxes for us to take. We decided that
          sixty mince pies would be enough, and each grabbed five boxes, before
          heading towards the self-serve checkouts to purchase our goods. On our
          way, Todd had for some reason decided that he was now a comedian, and
          kept making various quips about the products we passed. Even if these
          had been puns of quality, I would not be able to regale them here as I
          wasn't paying attention. I had probably already heard them in a tiktok
          from 2019 anyway.

          />
        </p>
        <p><em>The lattice mince pies.</em></p>
        <p>
          It was now time to pay for the pies. I noticed that the self-serve
          checkout immediately in front of me was out of order, so I went to
          another one. But Todd went to the broken one, despite my warnings! For
          a few seconds he stared at the screen, wondering what to do, and then
          came to join me at mine. I tried to make him go to the back of the
          queue for his error, but he didn't want to do that so I gave up. To
          make matters worse, he tried to show off his incredible new scanning
          technique to me, but I didn't care.
        </p>
        <p>
          With pies in tow, we returned to our bicycles. We discussed potential
          routes to the campus: we could take a route along the canal, or we
          could take the 'scenic route' up to Raddlebarn Farm Drive. The problem
          with the latter was that it started with a very big hill. I noted that
          to get to the canal we would also have to go up a hill to Mary Vale
          Road, but this apparently was less of a problem: the canal would make
          up for it. We headed out of the Morries car park and towards our
          destination. But just as we were about to pass the turning to the
          scenic route, Todd was gripped by madness. He said 'actually let's go
          right', contradicting literally everything we had just discussed.
          Nevertheless, I obeyed the command and turned right, which apparently
          was not what I was supposed to do because I was subsequently the
          victim of a torrent of rage including comments such as 'why did you
          cut me off'. This comment was rooted in falsity, as I had given him
          plenty of room and there was no traffic around whatsoever to cause any
          issues. Later on I overtook Todd again and was subject to even more
          unjustified rage.
        </p>
        <p>
          Despite this turbulent cycle, we eventually arrived at the Grange Road
          gate, the first stop on our mince pie mission. But there was a slight
          problem: the picket line was nowhere to be seen. This was mildly
          concerning, but we surmised that they must have opted to focus their
          efforts elsewhere. We cycled around to the next gate, the South Gate.
          But the story was the same here: nobody about. We proceeded to the
          East Gate, after struggling up the non-trivial incline of Edgbaston
          Park Road. There was nobody there either! Next up was the North Gate,
          but we had no luck there. On the way there I overtook Todd again as he
          pulled into a layby for no apparent reason: this time I did not hear
          the rage because I was speeding away from the approaching cars.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our last chance was at the West Gate, where we knew that several
          rallies had been held on previous days. Everyone must have been there
          instead! We traversed there quickly, cycling two abreast because it's
          safe and legal, and finally were greeted by a huge crowd of...
        </p>

        </p>
        <p>
          ...air particles navigating around a completely empty space. Where had
          everyone gone? Todd consulted his sources on Twitter. Apparently, all
          the picket lines had dispersed at midday every day so far and if we'd
          actually paid attention we would have known this. So this meant that
          we now had sixty mince pies to scoff. While I was thinking about this,
          Todd realised that his bike might have had a puncture, and this
          justified his poor riding: I remarked that this was unlikely to be the
          case. In response Todd called me a terrible person: I made an
          excellent strawman back and won the argument.
