        <h2>Prologue</h2>
        <p>
          In the good old days before the pandemic and before everyone in the
          computer science department dropped off the face of the earth, the
          Theory Group had a
          <a href="https://github.com/jamievicary/birmingham-theory"
            >nice website</a
          >
          with all our faces on it, maintained by resident website guru Jamie.
          It wasn't anything fancy but most importantly it <em>worked</em>.
          Updating this site was a breeze: just submit a pull request and within
          the next 24 hours your face would now be on the CS website for all the
          world to see. While this did have the unfortunate drawback that
          everyone could see your face, it did mean that you could actually
          convince people that you were a student and not a raving madman, which
          can be quite tricky in our line of work.
        </p>
        <p>
          At some point something went wrong with the cookie breaks website.
          While the issue was corrected, I was informed that there were some
          machinations going on behind the scenes, and at some point everything
          hosted on the CS servers would be transferred to the central
          university servers. Being the conscientious individual that I am, I
          stored this fact away in my mind for future use and then promptly
          forgot about it. The astute reader might be able to see what was about
          to happen.
        </p>
        <p>
          Several months later, the theory website that had served us so well
          vanished without a trace, and attempting to visit it just redirected
          you to the root computer science page. There was a mild furore in the
          Theory Microsoft Teams team in which everyone tried to work out what
          had happened. Eventually it was revealed that the transfer to the
          central site had gone ahead and a lot of things that had once lived on
          the CS servers had been jettisoned into the ether, never to return.
          More importantly, this meant that all non-staff faces had also been
          jettisoned with them: we had been demoted to a list inside a container
          that wasn't even visible when you loaded the page.
        </p>
        <p>
          Even worse, the cookie break site vanished! Now how would we know who
          would host the longest running social event in the school?
        </p>
        <h2>In which I acknowledge the benefits of the new system</h2>
        <p>
          The reasoning behind the shift to the central system is to bring all
          the university pages under one big umbrella, to ensure consistency
          between sites. The key component of this is forcing every department
          to make pages on Contensis, the university's content management
          system. This means that sites can be constructed (somewhat) simply in
          a Wordpress-style wysiwyg editor with content controlled using various
          widgets and templates, creating consistency across the site. Now I can
          get behind this: I like consistency and it is does make a site look
          far more professional, which presumably is what the university is
          trying to accomplish. Indeed, the old CS website was a real mishmash
          of styles and sometimes looked like it came out of the nineties.
        </p>
        <p>
          What you get out of Contensis is a <em>responsive</em> site that
          should look nice on all screens, even my
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung_SGH-E250"
            >Samsung SGH-E250 from 2007</a
          >
          that I never used the internet on for fear of spending a lot of money.
          Responsive web development is a big thing now and I've spent many
          hours trying to make my website look nice on mobile with some fancy
          CSS. I also half-ironically spent far too long
          <a href="https://github.com/jamievicary/act2021/pull/6"
            >trying to make the ACT 2021 website look good on mobile</a
          >, several weeks after the conference finished. Maybe using a content
          management system can actually take out some of the stress of this
          process?
        </p>
        <p>
          Even more importantly, the use of such a system also (in theory)
          ensures that the site complies with numerous (and important!)
          accessibility regulations, such as providing useful information to
          screen-readers. This is an incredibly strong point: it's essential
          that all the content on the website is accessible by all, otherwise
          there would be no point in putting the content up there in the first
          place! In fact, while writing this post I realised that my wanton use
          of strikethrough for comedic purposes would actually pose a problem
          for screenreaders, so I dutifully removed it all. Food for thought!
        </p>
        <h2>
          In which I rant about the systematic removal of phd presence from the
          website
        </h2>
        <p>
          However, the problem here is that this noble crusade for accessiblity
          is masking a different problem. in which the presence of computer
          science phd students has being systematically removed from the
          website! There used to be a section on the CS staff list for phd
          students and their faces, but this was removed the year I started so I
          was never on it. This should already have been ringing alarm bells,
          but in our naivete we assumed that the theory page would be all we'd
          ever need! Apparently, this was a mistake.
        </p>
        <p>
          The way that the new system works is that all staff have a profile set
          up with numerous properties (e.g. Computer Science, Theory, Theory
          lead and so on). Then content managers can insert a special widget
          that can filter out the appropriate staff depending on what page
          you're on and how you set it up. This is quite clever and in principle
          I think it is great to be able to have an automatically updating list
          so that you can edit a profile in one place and it updates sitewise.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, this has its drawbacks. First, the widget is too inflexible:
          for example, what if one doesn't want to have to show the whole spiel
          for every staff member, and just wants to show a concise grid of all
          staff? Too bad, you can't. You're limited to this voluminous list with
          big pictures and text that takes up quite a lot of space.
        </p>
        <p>
          And of course, as the topic of this rant might imply, the phd students
          are nowhere to be seen in this list! Despite what people may try to
          say, we <em>are not</em> just students: we contribute to the research
          community of the school and are an essential part of the system! And
          we do lots of marking too! I have been reliably informed by my smug
          European compatriots that phd students on the continent
          <em>are</em> in fact treated more like staff, so maybe we should take
          some ideas from them.
        </p>
        <p>
          But the problems don't stop there! Previously, all computer science
          phd students (and staff) had been able to serve their own webpage by
          putting a file in <code>~/public_html</code> on the school servers,
          and this would be hosted at
          <a href="http://cs.bham.ac.uk/~gjk591"
            >http://cs.bham.ac.uk/~gjk591</a
          >
          or something similar (or in my case, once you submit an IT ticket and
          make them change your undergrad privileges into postgrad ones). You
          can click on mine to verify what I'm saying if you want, but you'll be
          wasting your time as it just redirects to this site.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, new students have now been told that 'new university policy'
          is that these sites can't exist any more. The primary reason is again
          because the <code>cs.bham</code> servers are being decommissioned, and
          we can't just have random pages from our home directory being served
          to the central server. Moreover, we once again need to adhere to
          accessibility requirements, so the uni want everyone to do things
          through Contensis. Of course, as we know '<em
            >having no website is much better than having a bad website</em
          >' (as said by the wise
          <a href="https://alexarice.github.io/">Alex Rice</a>), so this is
          perfectly reasonable!
        </p>
        <p>That was satire, it is ridiculous.</p>
        <p>
          One might argue that nowadays the problem of getting online space is
          much smaller, as one can easily acquire a free
          <code>github.io</code> domain and host your content there, so we don't
          even <em>need</em> these pages! But the issue isn't necessarily with
          <em>hosting</em> the content. The benefit of having the old-style
          pages is that we can have an <em>official university domain</em> tied
          to our content and this, like having our faces on the site, makes us
          look a little bit more authentic. This is especially important with
          <em>early career</em> academics who don't have the clout to wave
          around some random <code>george.biz</code> domain and have everyone
          immediately visit it to check out our exciting discoveries.
        </p>
        <p>
          Of course, there is a very easy solution to this problem, which is
          just to give every phd student a space on the main website, which can
          even be managed through Contensis if needs be. While this would
          require a non-trivial effort to get off the ground (there must be a
          fair few phd students at the university), however I believe the
          benefits of having personal spaces would outweigh this, and once the
          initial bulk of work is done, it would only need to be touched once
          new students leave or join.
        </p>
        <h2>In which two plucky theorists try to save the day</h2>
        <p>
          Such a proposal would take months to get to anyone who actually had
          the power to sort this out, and in the end it probably wouldn't get
          sorted as they would drag their heels in and nothing would change. We
          needed a solution that could be implemented <em>now</em>. But who
          would be up to such a task? Enter intrepid theorists
          <a href="https://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~txd880/">Tom de Jong</a> and, as
          always, <a href="https://georgejkaye.com">yours truly</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          <img
            src="/images/adventures/contensis/sherlock.webp"
            alt="A crudely edited image where the faces of Tom de Jong and myself are pasted over the faces of Sherlock and Watson from the BBC series Sherlock, standing in front of the door to 221B Baker Street"
          />
        </p>
        <p><em>Tom de Jong and I begin our search for our faces.</em></p>
        <p>
          Our first line of attack was to get
          <a href="https://anupamdas.com">Anupam</a>, the current 'content
          owner' of the theory website, to do it for us. This would save us the
          job of having to do all the formatting ourselves, allowing us to get
          on with our <em>incredibly important</em> research into the less than
          symbol and Inkscape. Most of the hard work of actually getting the
          images wasn't even necessary, as they still remained within Jamie's
          repo, unserved to the world at large.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, this simple mission turned out to be anything but, as it
          turned out that it was quite hard to get hold of Anupam for various
          holiday and work-related reasons. Tom and I alternated between sending
          messages on various platforms, such as the incredibly active Microsoft
          Teams team and even electronic mail! But our efforts were met with
          little success, as nothing happened. At one point we changed tack, and
          offered to help out on the website ourselves, thinking ourselves
          competent enough to dip our toes into the mire. This suggestion was
          received positively, and yet nothing happened anyway. A message would
          have to be passed up the chain of command to central contensis
          control, and this small task was apparently quite difficult to do!
        </p>
        <p>
          Many months passed, 2020 became 2021, a third national lockdown was
          called, lived through, and relaxed, and eventually winter became
          spring became summer. There was only one option left: I would have to
          seek out Anupam in person. And there was a perfect time to do this:
          the first lunch back after my internship! This took place at the
          <a
            href="https://www.georgejkaye.com/2021/05/13/adventures-in-academia-part-four/"
            >scene of an earlier adventure</a
          >, but his time there were no pies in sight! In fact, I had been
          promised fish and chips, but there were no fish and chips, so actually
          I got a crazy vegan burger with avocado mayo instead. Filled with the
          millennial energy endowed to me by this green sauce, I prepared to
          bring up the topic of the website. This was a problem since the
          lunchtime chat was of course filled with all sorts of inane discourse,
          and it was very hard to get a word in edgeways! At one point
          <a href="https://puzzledoyster.github.io/">Ming</a> was asked if he
          would pose for some prospectus pictures, which the rest of us watched
          while guffawing heartily. Eventually there was a natural lull, and I
          managed to take control of the conversation in order to bring up the
          website. Anupam acknowledged that this had to be done, and promised to
          send the email that afternoon.
        </p>
        <p>
          On Monday, we looked on the theory page and discovered to our delight
          that our faces had arrived! Success! It seemed that our epic quest had
          finally come to an end. However, upon closer inspection, it became
          clear that there was a problem. When you looked at the page on your
          phone, as all trendy theorists such as myself would do, our faces
          spilled out of the central content container and into the wilderness
          of the page margins. Despite the purpose of Contensis being to make
          usable <em>responsive</em> pages, Anupam had managed to create a page
          that didn't render well on mobile! This was an incredibly impressive
          feat and quite funny, but it did have the unfortunate side effect that
          our faces didn't look very good.
        </p>
        <h2>In which the theorists finally achieve their goal</h2>
        <p>
          Several days later, we received an email. Tom and I had been CC'd into
          an email sent by Anupam to the higher powers. We were about to be
          enrolled on the Contensis training course! Although we had been warned
          it was somewhat painful, it was in reality pretty simple to do (I made
          a cute page about string diagrams!) and after some time, we finally
          received the golden ticket: edit permissions for
          <code>/research/activity/computer-science/theory-of-computation/</code
          >. It was time to do some damage.
        </p>
        <p>

            src="/images/adventures/contensis/menintheory.webp"
            alt="A crudely edited image where the faces of Tom de Jong and myself are pasted over the faces of the two Men in Black, Agent (de) Jay and Agent Kay, who are wielding large weapons"
          />
        </p>
        <p>
          <em
            >Tom de Jong and I prepare to tackle the mess that is the theory
            website.</em
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          We set up a zoom call and prepared to fix all that was wrong with the
          world. It was then that we realised the true gravity of the task that
          awaited us. I had imagined a workspace that, while perhaps inflexible,
          was somewhat responsive and easy to use, so that even people like me
          would be able to get stuck in with ease. It turned out that Contensis
          was anything but! It was slow, it was confusing, and it was incredibly
          hard to drag the widgets around the page without selecting the text on
          them. Moreover, doing anything with images required you to upload them
          elsewhere and then navigate back to them from the page you were
          editing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Despite the dread we felt, we remained optimistic and set about
          searching for a solution to the problem. About three operations in,
          the system stopped responding and attempting to navigate anywhere
          within the <code>/research</code> subsite produced a
          <code>503</code> error. Had we already managed to destroy the website
          within minutes of having edit permissions? I sent a tweet to the IT
          people to ask if this was the case, but then everything started
          responding again. I immediately deleted the tweet in case it was an
          admission of guilt, but later on the IT people managed to reply to it
          anyway.

          We quickly discovered the problem with the current layout. The trusty
          table was <em>not</em> a responsive element and would stubbornly
          refuse to wrap onto multiple rows if they were too long. While I
          admired their tenacity, this was not what we wanted from our lovely
          responsive site. Fortunately, our training was still fresh in our
          memories and we knew that the 'grid' was the responsive version that
          would scale and wrap appropriately with the size of the screen. We
          were already Contensis champions!
        </p>
        <p>
          But this presented us with a new problem. People with long names, such
          as my long-suffering colleague
          <a href="https://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~txw467/">Todd Waugh Ambridge</a>,
          would cause the images to be bumped down one line, so that the list of
          images was out of sync! Obviously this looked rubbish and we had to
          change it. After much umming and ahhing, the solution suddenly came to
          us: we could just put the text underneath the images instead. Our
          genius was indeed staggering.
        </p>
        <p>
          However there were still problems: just putting the text and image
          together in the grid cell didn't quite respond as well as we'd like:
          on small screens it would morph into strange patterns and the text
          would become separated from the pictures. This was not ideal.
          Fortunately Tom used his literature searching techniques to locate an
          'image with caption' widget, that allowed us to glue the people's
          names to their faces: exactly what we wanted! However, we also wanted
          to link the people's names to their webpages, and in this widget it
          only let you type in text and not link it anywhere. I jokingly
          suggested that we could just inject HTML into the caption box and see
          if it worked. We laughed heartily for a little bit and then realised
          that this plan was just crazy enough to work. And it did.
        </p>
        <p>
          After a tireless afternoon of cropping images and dragging widgets
          painfully around the webpage, we finally had the page in a way we
          wanted. After ten months of absence, our faces once more graced the
          theory page in an aesthetically pleasing way. The journey was over.
        </p>
        <p>
          Except actually it wasn't, because when we checked out the published
          page, none of the pictures were there. I found this curious given that
          Contensis was meant to make good pages and yet clearly this one wasn't
          quite there yet. After a bit of poking around and emailing a man, we
          found out that in addition to publishing the page we also had to
          publish each new image separately. Why this had not been flagged when
          we initially published the page was never discovered.
        </p>

          <img
            src="/images/adventures/contensis/people.webp"
            alt="Our improved grid of PhD students on the theory page, where each image is the same size and all in line"
          />
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>The improved grid of PhD students.</em>
          <em>Notice anyone familiar?</em>
        </p>
        <h2>
          In which I rant about why I don't like Contensis and what I would do
          about it
        </h2>
        <p>
          So we had managed to make a page in Contensis with our faces on it. It
          had taken about three hours, which is far longer than it would have
          taken if we had done the same procedure in raw HTML. The main problem
          is just how slowly Contensis runs when trying to perform any
          operation. This makes the whole procedure a lot more frustrating than
          it needs to be, especially if you're just trying to add one image and
          put it somewhere. The sluggishness is presumably partially due to
          running in the browser. Perhaps there is a desktop version that runs a
          lot smoother, but I wasn't told about it!
        </p>
        <p>
          For those less well versed in HTML lore, this wysiwyg approach is
          probably good, and indeed may be the only way they know how to. And I
          acknowledge this: the problem is that we are a computer science
          department, and a lot of us <em>do</em> know what we're doing! This
          illuminates one of my biggest problems with centralising everything:
          if we limit everyone to the lowest common denominator then the people
          with the higher denominators are going to get very frustrated. It
          feels to me like railroading the content creators into using Contensis
          is actually very patronising and illustrates a lack of trust that
          we'll make something competent. I'm sure there are people who would
          make completely incompetent HTML sites, but there are also those who
          can make very good ones!
        </p>
        <p>
          The ideal solution is obviously to teach everyone HTML, but I don't
          think people are going to want to do this. Although saying this, it
          probably takes just as long to get a working knowledge of HTML as it
          is to figure out what's going on with Contensis, so maybe it is a
          possibility. What the system really needs is the <em>option</em> to go
          'under-the-hood' and let us manipulate the actual HTML. This strikes
          the perfect middle-ground: people who don't know what they're doing
          can continue about their business while we can get stuck in at the
          source. Editing the source directly makes it a lot easier to
          manipulate the code of the page: we can copy and paste our widgets
          rather than having to try and find the three-pixel sweetspot that lets
          us drag it into the next column. There are plenty of editors that
          allow you to swap between wysiwyg and raw HTML on the fly. Since we're
          still only letting people edit the actual content of the page, we
          don't need to be too concerned about people messing up the consistent
          theming. And if we're worried about people not knowing what they're
          doing, we can lock away the option until they've done some training
          course.
        </p>
        <p>
          What about ensuring that whatever we write up is still
          accessibility-compliant? Well, there are plenty of tools that can
          automatically check against key accessibility criteria and give you a
          report flagging up the main issues with the page. I'm sure that these
          can be built into the system and if there are too many problems then
          the page can be outright rejected.
        </p>
        <p>
          But now we have to be realistic. With the student body getting larger
          every year, academics just don't have enough time to learn how to use
          HTML, Git, and who knows what else. So with a heavy heart I accept
          that we'll be staying with Contensis for a while longer. We have
          reasons to be positive though: now that they're introducing computer
          science and coding earlier and earlier throughout the curriculum,
          perhaps the next generation will be ready to make the leap! Moreover,
          since lots of things are getting easier on Windows these days, when
          the glorious revolution comes we (probably) won't even have to make
          everyone install some obscure Linux distro just to be able to access
          their module webpage! Who would have thought that Windows might be our
          saviour at the end of all of this?
        </p>
        <h2>In which the phd students ascend to a higher plane</h2>
        <p>
          With our immense task done, we patted ourselves on the back and kept
          going back to the page every now and again to remark at how well we'd
          done. But this wasn't the end of the story. Anupam himself had mooted
          that the big list of staff at the top of the page was an eyesore: it
          took up too much space and widened the gulf between permanent staff
          and us lowly phd students. Instead we should just put everything in
          the same grid style we had used before! I agreed, and while Tom was
          initially uncertain, he eventually came to see the light and accepted
          that this should be done.
        </p>
        <p>
          We opted to undertake this task on the next Friday. But disaster
          struck, as Tom was apparently busy! This meant we would have to
          postpone until the next week. Safe in the knowledge that I had nothing
          important to do, I went to my meetings and the true final destination:
          the pub!
        </p>
        <p>
          While I was enjoying a nice drink (and being abused for my choice of a
          gin, the nation's favourite spirit, over a more manly pursuit such as
          commercialised urine), and tucking into a slice of pie, something
          astounding was happening. Tom was apparently not busy after all, and
          moreover was bored, so he had gone into overdrive and had translated
          the rest of the theory page into our new style. This meant I had
          nothing to do except look at the page, make appreciative sounds, and
          send a thumbs up emoji. What a rollercoaster of a Friday!

        <h2>Epilogue</h2>
        <p>
          So that's the tale about how two theory phd students got our faces
          back on the theory page. Although it is a small victory in the battle
          to get the phd students recognised, it is an important one and
          hopefully a sign of things to come. Our next battle? Getting the phd
          students onto the main staff list.
        </p>
        <p>
          Also the cookie break site needs to be resurrected. But that's a tale
          for another time.

        <h2>Postscript</h2>

          Comically, the canonical method I present to people to get to the
          theory site is still to go to my website first, and then click on the
          link in the first paragraph, because navigating to it through the uni
          site is a mess. Ah well, you can't have everything.
