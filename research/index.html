      <h2>Research interests</h2>
      <p>
        My primary research interests are in graphical calculi for compositional
        systems and the lambda calculus using monoidal categories, and reasoning
        about these structures diagrammatically using
        <a href="https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.0908.3347">string diagrams</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        My PhD thesis detailed
        <strong
          >a fully compositional theory of sequential digital circuits with
          delay and feedback</strong
        >. This project was based on work by
        <a href="https://doi.org/10.4230/LIPIcs.CSL.2017.24">Ghica and Jung</a>
        who modelled digital circuits as morphisms in a
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traced_monoidal_category"
          >symmetric traced monoidal category</a
        >. My job was to tidy this all up and make it formal, leading to three
        sound and complete semantics for sequential circuits: a
        <strong>denotational</strong> semantics of monotone stream functions, a
        reductions-based <strong>operational semantics</strong>, and an
        <strong>algebraic semantics</strong>. Using recent work on
        <a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/3502719"
          >string diagram graph rewriting</a
        >, this gives us a framework suitable for performing
        <strong>graph rewriting</strong> on digital circuits.

          In this paper we adapt previous work on rewriting string diagrams
          using hypergraphs to the case where the underlying category has a
          traced comonoid structure, in which wires can be forked and the
          outputs of a morphism can be connected to its input. Such a structure
          is particularly interesting because any traced Cartesian (dataflow)
          category has an underlying traced comonoid structure. We show that
          certain subclasses of hypergraphs are fully complete for traced
          comonoid categories: that is to say, every term in such a category has
          a unique corresponding hypergraph up to isomorphism, and from every
          hypergraph with the desired properties, a unique term in the category
          can be retrieved up to the axioms of traced comonoid categories. We
          also show how the framework of double pushout rewriting (DPO) can be
          adapted for traced comonoid categories by characterising the valid
          pushout complements for rewriting in our setting. We conclude by
          presenting a case study in the form of recent work on an equational
          theory for sequential circuits: circuits built from primitive logic
          gates with delay and feedback. The graph rewriting framework allows
          for the definition of an operational semantics for sequential
          circuits.

          This thesis details the culmination of a project to define a fully
          compositional theory of synchronous sequential circuits built from
          primitive components, motivated by applying techniques successfully
          used in programming languages to hardware. The first part of the
          thesis defines the syntactic foundations required to create sequential
          circuit morphisms, and then builds three different semantic theories
          on top of this: denotational, operational and algebraic. We
          characterise the denotational semantics of sequential circuits as
          certain causal stream functions, as well as providing a link to
          existing circuit methodologies by mapping between circuit morphisms,
          stream functions and Mealy machines. The operational semantics is
          defined as a strategy for applying some global transformations
          followed by local reductions in order to demonstrate how a circuit
          processes a value, leading to a notion of observational equivalence.
          The algebraic semantics consists of equations for bringing circuits
          into a pseudo-normal form, and then encoding between different state
          sets. This part of the thesis concludes with a discussion of some
          novel applications, such as those for using partial evaluation for
          digital circuits. While mathematically rigorous, the categorical
          string diagram formalism is not suited for reasoning computationally.
          The second part of this thesis details an extension of existing work
          on string diagram rewriting with hypergraphs so that it is compatible
          with the traced comonoid structure present in the category of digital
          circuits. We identify the properties that characterise cospans of
          hypergraphs corresponding to traced comonoid terms, and demonstrate
          how to identify rewriting contexts valid for rewriting modulo traced
          comonoid structure. We apply the graph rewriting framework to fixed
          point operators as well as the operational semantics from the first
          part, and present a new hardware description language based on these
          theoretical developments.
