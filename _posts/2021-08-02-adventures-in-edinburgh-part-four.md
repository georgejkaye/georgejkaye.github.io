An ongoing 
During our exploration of the Royal Mile earlier that week we had stopped by the Scottish Parliament building and gazed up towards Arthur's Seat, which used to be a volcano before some guy call Arthur plonked a chair on top of it. 
We had organised a large squad to ascend 

It turned out that the seat itself was just a trig pillar, which wasn't very comfortable: I should know, I sat on it.
Maybe it was just because of the rain.

We descended the mountain via an alternative route.
It soon became apparent that this was an incredibly slippy route and I became increasingly concerned for my wellbeing.
Fortunately I survived despite some scares and reached flat ground once again.
Rather than head back the way we came, Cláudio led us along what used to be a railway, and through a long tunnel.
It turned out that this was a [national cycle route](https://www.sustrans.org.uk/find-a-route-on-the-national-cycle-network/route-1) and one could follow it all the way to the coast.
We decided that we would do this the next day.

As we wandered back home, we immediately went the wrong way and had to double back on ourselves.
Since we needed food, we stopped in at a very swanky Co
Neither of us knew what we wanted for tea but we thought pizza might be 
Unfortunately, I wasn't impressed with the selection on offer, as my tastes have been spoiled too much by the bougie pizzas they sell in Waitrose.
This frustrated Todd to no end, but I refused to get any of these pizzas and we made a note to stop in at Tesco to see if they had any better ones.
The selection there wasn't much better, but they had a Finest™ ham and mascarpone which could just about live up to my lofty tastes.
Todd opted for a


We had travelled for about ten minutes when I realised that the really obvious route that we were following wasn't so obvious, so I had to whip out my phone to check where to go.
Then I discovered that I had two missed Messenger calls from Dan and a message telling me to call him back as something urgent had come up.
This had happened about a minute ago, so I rang back, but he didn't pick up.
I tried again in the hope that this time he would pick up, but he didn't.
Then Todd tried while I sent a message saying that I had tried to call him but he hadn't picked up.
Todd's attempt didn't work, so I was about to try again but then Dan called me.
It turned out that Dan's phone didn't tell him that people were calling until he actually opened Messenger, a fantastic design feature.
Fortunately, it turned out that we already knew the important news, and so we could proceed on our journey.

We proceeded through

We cycled back along the cycle path and then traversed

That evening, it was time for my introduction to the cult classic that was The Big Lebowski.
I had been informed by many people that this was one of the greatest films ever made, so it would have to be good.
I had also been warned that the film 'didn't really have a plot, it was more of an experience', which sounded like classic film person guff.
It turned out that the film did in fact have a plot and it was incredibly easy to follow, which must mean that everyone else who watched it must have been morons.

Midway through the film, I dared to look at my phone for a fraction of a millisecond.
This greatly enraged Todd and I was subject to several minutes of anger during which I was told that I would miss essential plot details.
Given that this was just a film about bowling, I somewhat doubted this.
It later transpired that Todd had told Tom de Jong about my transgression and I was subject to more abuse the next day on a video call.

Eventually the time rolled around for us to return to Birmingham.
Just before we left the flat, I thought I'd tuck into a nice piece of cheese.
The thinking man would have acquired a nice sharp knife for this, but my intelligence transcended this and I picked up a regular knife that was sitting on the counter nearby, saving myself approximately half a second.
Overcome by insatiable hunger, I began to carve myself a chunky slice.
But there was one last twist in the tale: the unstoppable force that was my grip met the immovable object that was a slightly chilly block of cheese, and the only thing that could give was the knife itself, which prompty bifurcated and became embedded within the block.

I put the knife in the bin and we absconded immediately.
