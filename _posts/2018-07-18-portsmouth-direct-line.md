title: Portsmouth Direct Line Remastered

I took the plunge with the remastered [Portsmouth Direct Line: London Waterloo to Portsmouth](https://store.steampowered.com/app/820203/Train_Simulator_Portsmouth_Direct_Line_London_Waterloo__Portsmouth_Route_AddOn/) route and have been playing through the included scenarios. It's quite an enjoyable drive, especially as I've never been to Waterloo. The included trains look pretty and are definitely an improvement on the old ones (especially the old 450!) but needed an AP patch to make them sound just right!

I'm working on a scenario based on a service from Waterloo towards Dorking, although I think I've underestimated exactly how much traffic there is in the Waterloo and Clapham Junction area!
