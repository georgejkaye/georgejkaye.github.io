tagline: Todd and I ascend to Edinburgh for two weeks of hard work in the office. This time, we visit some bridges and go on an ironic bike ride.

Todd was irritatingly smug that Andrew Neil had responded to his tweet.
This was greatly annoying as nobody has ever responded to me on Twitter, except for the guy who plays Maria's dad in Sarah Jane Adventures, who I make a habit of bantering with whenever I watch it.
I also once won a competition to win some free orange twirls, but they fobbed me off with a hidden term and condition stating that only people living in the centre of Birmingham could get them delivered.
I might have relented had this been a reasonable precondition, and if I were a moron.
In fact, I could have walked to the end of my road and been within the catchment area, and I informed Cadbury of this via a private message.
They never responded to me, and I never got my orange twirls.
I was therefore quite envious of Todd's newfound Twitter fame.
However, a cursory read of the myriad replies made it clear that literally everyone was against him, and so he would probably be crying himself to sleep tonight.
This made me feel much better.

After all this excitement, it was definitely time to get back to work on our top secret projects.
A few minutes passed before we were immediately thrown back into turmoil.
As part of some sort of festival, Todd and I had signed up to receive some free food, as all mortal men must do.
We had assumed that this would be a little pot of leftovers.
However, we actually received two whole ducks of rather large size.
While we were indeed voracious eaters, even we could not consume such astounding portions.
Nevertheless we had transported the ducks and their accompanying trimmings to our fridge at home.
But now something had arisen - Dan desired our second duck!
And we were all too happy to provide, but there was a problem: the duck was in the airbnb and we were not.
This meant that I had to wayfare at high velocity back to the flat, ascend eight flights of stairs, and retrieve it!
With duck in hand, I returned to the office and stored it safely in the fridge, which the ducks had actually been removed from the day before.
Later Dan asked where the duck was, as he could not find it in the fridge.
I responded that it was actually in the fridge, as I had placed it there myself.
But Dan was adamant that it wasn't in the fridge!
Where had the duck gone?
But we had all been deceived, for a second fridge had been made: it turned out the fourth floor had a secret fridge that I had not been aware of, and it was this fridge that Dan had checked.
After this had been resolved, the exchange was performed, and now we only had to consume one duck, a far easier proposal.

Soon enough it was time to head home for the day.
