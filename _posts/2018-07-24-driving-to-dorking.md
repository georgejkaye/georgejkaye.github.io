alttext: 1D13 0824 London Waterloo to Dorking
tagline: In between watching the World Cup, working at Waitrose and rewatching Classic Who serials, I whipped up a short scenario on the new Portsmouth Direct Line! Rush hour London really is packed with traffic, as I woefully failed to realise before committing myself to 1D13 rather than a more peaceful afternoon scenario. But it was alright in the end, and the editor didn't even crash on me that much which was a plus. The only downside is having to renumber all the stock and remembering whether the destination code is for Waterloo or London Waterloo - who needs consistency?

In between watching the World Cup, working at Waitrose and rewatching Classic Who serials, I whipped up a short scenario on the new Portsmouth Direct Line! Rush hour London really is packed with traffic, as I woefully failed to realise before committing myself to 1D13 rather than a more peaceful afternoon scenario. But it was alright in the end, and the editor didn't even crash on me that much which was a plus. The only downside is having to renumber all the stock and remembering whether the destination code is for Waterloo or London Waterloo - who needs consistency?

I also failed to realise how intense all those new 450s and 444s were - even my beefy machine turned early morning Waterloo into a slideshow before my eyes. Of course, even though I had seen suggestions to replace the new stock with the original RSC stock, I didn't actually bother to do it until the end - which resulted in a lengthy session in RW_Tools changing all the destination codes from numbers to letters. But that's all part of the slightly shambolic Train Simulator scenario experience, I suppose.
