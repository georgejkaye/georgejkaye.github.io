All the way back in March 2020, [Alex]({{ people.alex.web }}), [Calin]({{ people.calin.web }}) and I were looking forward to going to [SYCO 7](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/events/syco/7/), which would have been taking place in Estonia!
However, it seemed like the universe had other ideas, and a mild global pandemic swept the globe, cancelling quite a few events including everyone's favourite category theory conference.
But now, twenty-one months later, it had been revived in the form of [SYCO 8](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/events/syco/8/): although quite invisible to the untrained eye, this was exactly the same workshop but with its number incremented by one!

As with all trips in late 2021, there was plenty of umming and ahhing over whether we would actually get to go.
Omicron had arrived and suddenly all our very carefully executed plans to withdraw literally every restriction in one go were somehow being overwhelmed! 
Eventually I decided was time to put my foot down and just get on with it anyway and see what would happen, and keep my fingers crossed that I wouldn't get stuck in Estonia over the Christmas holidays.
After all, there were worse things that could happen!

The first step was to pass through the small bottleneck of getting the university to approve my login for [Key Travel](https://my.keytravel.com/uk/), the university's travel portal.
Of course, such bureaucracy makes the world go round, and as a lowly PhD student I cannot be trusted with such a powerful portal unless vetted by the appropriate authorities!
Fortunately, my innately honed ability to send multiple emails at repeated, yet sufficiently spaced, intervals eventually proved true and I was granted access.
Success!

I immediately dived in and set about putting things in my basket.
As I went back and forth between pages as I tried to work out the best way to fill in all the field, the prices for the Ryanair flights fluctuated violently and I feared that the precious seats were being snapped up at that very moment!
I then realised that this was a complete non-issue since I wasn't paying anyway.
Proceeding to the checkout, I pressed the book button with confidence, and waited for a while as nothing appeared to happen.
But then to my horror a dialog popped up saying that there was an unknown error and I should try later!
Deciding that 'later' actually meant 'immediately', I smashed the button again, but to no avail: the same error returned.
At that moment, I received some emails, and I tabbed out to check them: to my surprise they were from Key Travel!
But there were two emails: had I been conned by such an innocent error into booking my flights twice?
Would I have to find [someone else with the name George Kaye](https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=george+kaye) to travel with me on some strange, wonderful, George Kaye-themed roadtrip?
Alas, such an event was not to be as upon closer inspection both the emails were for the same trip.
Somehow, despite my best efforts to mess everything up with my standard hubris, everything had turned out okay.
If only all things in life were so simple!

With the journeys settled, the only thing left to do was prepare slides and wait for the
However I was lured by the promise of a [lattice mince pie](https://www.georgejkaye.com/blog/adventures/part-seven/)
