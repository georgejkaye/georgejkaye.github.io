Barely a week had passed since I had last ventured into Stirchley, and I had not seen a reason to go there again.
There was still nobody around so we hadn't gone to sample to local bars, and more than one fish and chips in one week is something I'm not brave enough to do.
This had the fortunate side effect of me actually doing some work for once, and I researched at least one thing.
But this was all about to change...

Unlike me, Todd had been wasting his time on Twitter, a platform he occasionally uses to make tweets about Labour that nobody reads.
However, what he found today was nothing to do with centre-left socialism.
In fact, it was something drawn from the depths of capitalist manipulation: Morries were doing half price breakfasts.
The reason?
Nobody could tell, but it seemed like a deal too good to be true.
But it had to be true, as the [Advertising Standards Authority](https://www.asa.org.uk/) and, perhaps more crucially, the [Twitter Terms of Service](https://twitter.com/en/tos), gives them a legal incentive not to lie!
There was no doubt about it: the breakfasts were real.

*A similar deal I found on google images; it might not be the same one*

And so, a deal was made:

I pondered this deal for a few seconds, wondering if a Friday morning was really suitable for such an outlandish excursion.
I then concluded that, yes, of course it was, and it would provide a good amount of protein to bolster my weak bones in addition to my recommended daily amount of calories in one meal.
The strength I would possess would be unmatched in Stirchley, except perhaps for Todd who would probably have what I was having but with more sausages, a notorious source of protein!

The day rolled around and I woke early.


Upon waking, Todd had immediately disabled his alarm and returned to his slumber, a classic blunder!

Fortunately he had recovered Noam's bike from his old house and could now use it to traverse the half a mile between his house and Morries.
He arrived minutes after I did, and promptly retold the story to me.
Suddenly he realised that in his haste he forgotten to put gloves on, and now his hands had become slightly chilly.
I of course had not needed any gloves for my far longer ride, as molten rock flows through my veins.


I smugly told him that if he didn't put his D lock through his back wheel it would be stolen instantly, as 'the back one is the valuable one'.
Todd ignored this helpful advice and put the D lock through the middle of his frame.





Infuriatingly, Todd's back wheel was exactly where we'd left it.
