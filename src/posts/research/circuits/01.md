## Introduction

Digital circuit

In the business, reasoning with circuits is generally performed by translating them into some sort of automata (such as a Mealy or a Moore machine) and then *simulating* them for some given inputs.

To do this, we must look o
Circuits are constructed from the basic building blocks of *logic gates*.
We can then compose these together in a variety of ways to 

If these seem familiar then 

## Syntax

To construct circuits formally, we can model them as morphisms (or *terms*) in a *symmetric monoidal category*.
Rather than using the traditional method of writing terms as one-dimensional text strings, we will use the graphical syntax of *string diagrams* \[JS81, Sel10\].
Not only does this make things a lot clearer, it has a practical benefit in that it can eliminate a lot of structural bureaucracy, such as having to deal with associativity all the time.

In string diagrams, a morphism $F : X \to Y$ is drawn as a box {% tikz "fcirc-labelled" %}.
The graphical notation lends itself well to the various categorical operations and constructs: composition, tensor, the identity and the symmetry are illustrated below.

{% figure %}
{% tikz "seq" %}
{% tikz "par" %}
{% tikz "id-labelled" %}
{% tikz "sym-labelled" %}
{% endfigure %}

Since we want to construct circuits of arbitrary size, our category will need to be *freely generated* over some set of *generators*.
These generators are the basic building blocks of terms in our category

In general, we can view a generator (or a composite term) {% tikz "fcirc-labelled" %} as a process that takes an input of type $X$ and produces an output of type $Y$.
But in our case we need not be so general!
When considering circuits, the input and output types simply correspond to the number of open wires, so we can let the types be natural numbers.
An SMC with natural numbers as objects is called a *products and permutations category*, or *prop* for short.
A nice byproduct of this is that we can write a morphism $m \to n$ as a box with $m$ input wires and $n$ output wires, and drop the wire labels.

When drawing boxes with multiple wires, we will often compress them into a single wires like {% tikz "fcirc" %}, but the actual number should be clear from context.

### Circuit signatures

Now it is time to actually start defining our category of digital circuits.
We begin by specifying the generators: the components that we can plug together.

{% defn "Circuit signature" %}
    A circuit signature is a tuple $\Sigma = (\mathcal{V},\mathcal{G})$ where $\mathcal{V}$ is a finite set of *values* and $\mathcal{G}$ is a finite set of *gates* with associated arities.
{% enddefn %}

{% ex %}
    Throughout this series we will use $\Sigma_\star = (V, G)$ where $V = \{\mathsf{t},\mathsf{f}\}$ and $G = \{(\text{AND},2),(\text{OR},2),(\text{NOT},2)\}$.
{% endex %}

### Combinational circuits

First we will look at *combinational* circuits.
These are circuits that act exactly as functions do: one gives them some inputs and they always return the same output, with no concept of delay or feedback.
Common examples are adders, which are everywhere in circuits!

{% defn %}
    Let $\mathbf{Circ}_{\Sigma}$ be the symmetric monoidal category generated freely over generators
    {% figure %}
        {% tikz "" %}
    {% endfigure %}
    
{% enddefn %}
