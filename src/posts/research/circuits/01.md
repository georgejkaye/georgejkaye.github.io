## Introduction

Digital circuit

In the business, reasoning with circuits is generally performed by translating them into some sort of automata (such as a Mealy or a Moore machine) and then *simulating* them for some given inputs.

To do this, we must look o
Circuits are constructed from the basic building blocks of *logic gates*.
We can then compose these together in a variety of ways to 

If these seem familiar then 

## Syntax


First we will look at *combinational* circuits.
These are circuits that act exactly as functions do: one gives them some inputs and they always return the same output, with no concept of delay or feedback.
Common examples are adders, which are everywhere in circuits!
