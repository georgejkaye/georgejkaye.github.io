## Introduction

Digital circuit

In the business, reasoning with circuits is generally performed by translating them into some sort of automata (such as a Mealy or a Moore machine) and then *simulating* them for some given inputs.

To do this, we must look o
Circuits are constructed from the basic building blocks of *logic gates*.
We can then compose these together in a variety of ways to
