## Introduction

Digital circuit

In the business, reasoning with circuits is generally performed by translating them into some sort of automata (such as a Mealy or a Moore machine) and then *simulating* them for some given inputs.

To do this, we must look o
Circuits are constructed from the basic building blocks of *logic gates*.
We can then compose these together in a variety of ways to 

If these seem familiar then 

## Syntax

To build circuits formally, we can model them as morphisms (or *terms*) in a *freely generated monoidal category*.
These settings are equipped with a set of *generators* that we can then smash together in sequence and parallel.
Therefore before we can dive into constructing a circuit we must specify these generators: the basic building blocks of the circuit.

{% defn "Circuit signature" %}
    A circuit signature is a tuple $\Sigma = (\mathcal{V},\mathcal{G})$ where $\mathcal{V}$ is a finite set of *values* and $\mathcal{G}$ is a finite set of *gates* with associated arities.
{% enddefn %}

{% ex %}
    Throughout this series we will $\Sigma_\star = (V, G)$ where $V = \{\mathsf{t},\mathsf{f}\}$ and $G = \{(\text{AND},2),(\text{OR},2),(\text{NOT},2)\}$.

### Combinational circuits

Traditionally, terms in monoidal categories are written as one-dimensional strings, by combining the generators with symbols such as $;$ and $\otimes$ to denote sequential and parallel composition.
This can get unwieldy fast when dealing with anything more complex than a few generators.
From a practical viewpoint, it is also quite an *inefficient* representation, as lots of structural axioms get in the way.

Fortunately, the language of *string diagrams* [JS91,Sel10] can save the day.
In this case, a morphism $F : m \to n$ is written as a box ![](/tikz/components/fcirc.svg) with $m$ wires on its left and $n$ wires on its right.

Recently, 


Rather than reasoning purely with one-dimensional categorical 

First we will look at *combinational* circuits.
These are circuits that act exactly as functions do: one gives them some inputs and they always return the same output, with no concept of delay or feedback.
Common examples are adders, which are everywhere in circuits!
