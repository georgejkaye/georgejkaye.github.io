## Introduction

Digital circuit

In the business, reasoning with circuits is generally performed by translating them into some sort of automata (such as a Mealy or a Moore machine) and then *simulating* them for some given inputs.

To do this, we must look o
Circuits are constructed from the basic building blocks of *logic gates*.
We can then compose these together in a variety of ways to 

If these seem familiar then 

## Syntax


First we will look at *combinational* circuits.
These are circuits that act exactly as functions do: one gives them some inputs and they always return the same output, with no concept of delay or feedback.
Common examples are adders, which are everywhere in circuits!

To build circuits formally, we can use the framework of *freely generated symmetric monoidal categories*.
These settings are equipped with a set of *generators* that we can then smash together in sequence and parallel.
Firstly we must specify the components of our circuits.
Yes I agree
