## Machines at the front

There are *two* computers at the front of LG23: the 'zoom computer' controlled
by the touch screen terminal, and the more conventional computer with the mouse
and keyboard.
As far as I know, there's no way to cast from conventional computer to the
big screen, but the big screen can be mirrored on the monitor on the podium by
changing the source of the latter.
(I believe the computer is DisplayPort and the big screen is HDMI, but I could be mistaken.)

## Connecting the room to the zoom

First make sure the big television screen is on (it often already is).

![Controls for the screen in LG23: the 'Display > ON' button is illuminated.](/images/lg23/screen-controls.jpg)

If it's not on, try pressing the 'ON' button on the control panel to see if that shocks the screen into life.
If this isn't successful, don't panic: try pressing the power button on the bottom of the screen,
and make sure the screen is powered on (the plug is directly beneath it).

If the screen is on, it should show a nice picture of Chancellor's Court
If it just says 'no signal', this means that someone's messed around with it; there should be an
HDMI cable behind the screen that connects the bottom HDMI port to the underside of a box
on the wall, which should have some flashing ethernet lights on it.

Once you're satisfied that everything is good, start by pressing 'Join' on the zoom terminal:

If you press the down arrow by the 'Meeting ID' box you can usually find the 'Theory Lab Lunch and Seminar' meeting in the list, to save you having to type it in manually.
If it's not there for whatever reason, the meeting id is *818 7333 5084*.

You will then be prompted for the password, which is *217*.

You will then be in the meeting!
If you turned on the big screen, the room camera's picture should now be visible on it.
You can use the 'Camera control' option on the zoom terminal to adjust the picture if it's at a weird angle or zoom.

If the room is quite talkative while people filter in before the seminar, it may be a good idea to go on mute.
Don't forget to unmute when the talk starts!

## Setting up the speaker

There are two options: the speaker can either use their own laptop or the conventional computer to present.
If using the latter, you'll need to log on using your university credentials.
The process is otherwise the same for both: connect to the zoom call using the above details and then the speaker can screenshare.
There is a 'smart' webcam that can follow the speaker around the room: just use the silver USB cable.
(Hopefully the speaker has a USB-A port or appropriate dongle: the former are few and far between these days!)

Now you can make sure the speaker is screen sharing correctly and that they can change slides and so on.
Once this is done, the 'speaker thumbnail' in the corner of the screen needs to be disabled, as it can get in the way for the physical participants.
To do this, select 'View' from the meeting controls:

![The zoom terminal shows the meeting controls, with 'View' circled.](/images/lg23/controls-view.jpg)

Make sure 'Speaker' is selected, then tap on 'Layout Options':

![The 'View' panel, with 'Speaker' and 'Layout Options' circled.](/images/lg23/view-options.jpg)

Now select 'Off' to banish the speaker thumbnail altogether!

If you need to access the participants, for example to spotlight the speaker or mute someone, this can be done through the zoom terminal directly.
