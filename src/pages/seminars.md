## General tasks

### Get a `talks@bham` account

The seminars are listed and advertised on [talks@bham](talks.bham.ac.uk).
`talks@bham` is used for talks all over the university, including some other
seminar series in the department, such as the departmental seminar series.
Users can sign up to email announcements for emails, or subscribe to `.ics`
calendars for series they are interested in.

If you haven't already got an account, you can sign up using the
[Request an account page](http://talks.bham.ac.uk/user/new).
Note that you will need to use a `bham.ac.uk` account otherwise the email won't
be sent to you!

Once you have an account, check everything works by [logging in](http://talks.bham.ac.uk/login/other_users).
You can also log in by clicking 'Birmingham users' in the left hand bar.

![The navigation bar for talks@bham, with 'Birmingham users' circled](/images/seminars/loggingin.webp)

The talk list we're interested in is the
[Theoretical computer science seminar](http://talks.bham.ac.uk/show/index/86).
Once you have an account, the previous organiser(s) can add you as an admin to
this list so you can add and modify talks.

You should also make sure you can access the [Seminar spreadsheet](https://bham.sharepoint.com/:x:/r/sites/TheoryofComputation-Research/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7B1A12E153-21AD-4609-AC89-5A0CFB95AFF4%7D&file=seminars.xlsx).

### Establish the seminar slot

The first thing to do when setting up the seminars for a term is to establish
the slot.
Ideally, this would be the same slot as the previous term, but teaching
commitments may affect this.
The timetable should be confirmed a few weeks before term starts; if you are not
in the loop with the procedure you could ask the head of education or other
members of the theory group.

If the slot isn't available, a new one needs to be found!
It was decided in the theory group meeting in January 2023 that the theory
seminar has *highest priority after teaching* for taking a time slot.
This means that, providing you poll the rest of the group early enough, people
should make an effort to accommodate the seminar!
Even if the slot does have to be moved, the first preference is to keep the
seminar on Fridays.

### Book the rooms

Once the slot is confirmed, you need to book the rooms.
Before you go ahead and start booking every single Friday in the term, remember
to leave a space for at least the theory group meeting.
The date of this should have been decided at the end of the previous theory
group meeting, but if you don't know when it is you can ask other members of the
group and hopefully someone will know.

Room bookings within the CS building are done via
[Clearooms](https://portal.clearooms.com/meeting-rooms), which hopefully you
should be familiar with. If for some reason you have not used Clearooms before,
you can login at the
[Single sign on page](https://api.clearooms.com/users/sso/9fa563df-48d3-4cd3-b6b3-6853cea99923/login).
Barring special cases, the seminar should be held in **LG23** in Computer
Science, which lives in the **Zone D - Lower Ground Floor** category.
I tend to make the bookings for ten minutes before the seminar starts to ten
minutes after the scheduled end time.
For example, if the talk is **11:00 - 11:50** then the room booking should be
made for **10:50 - 12:00**.

Clearooms does not at the time of writing have capability for making recurring
bookings, so you will need to make them one by one.
Have fun!

#### When LG23 isn't available

Sometimes you may be asked to move a room booking because the school wants to
have interviews in LG23, or perhaps someone was even more on the ball than you
and the room is already booked!
After grumbling about this for a bit you can instead turn to the
[Central university room booking portal](https://bhamtimetables.bham.ac.uk/2324Prod/ADlogin.html)
to book a room on campus; a room with 30+ capacity should be fine.
The Old Gym is a tried-and-tested theory favourite, and the Murray Learning
Centre is close by but the rooms aren't as nice.
Usually central rooms will only be bookable for hour slots, but since you will
mostly be working around lectures, the previous occupants should be done at
around ten minutes before the hour anyway.

Only staff members can use the room booking site, but if you are a PhD student
who also TAs you can use your staff account.
If you can't login to the system you can always ask someone more familiar with
it!

*(I currently can't provide any guidance on how to use it because I myself can't
access it. However, I'll get a staff account soon so I can add some pictures.)*

### Add seminars to `talks@bham`

With the rooms booked, the (unassigned) talks can all be added to `talks@bham`.
You can add a new talk at the
[Add a new talk page](http://talks.bham.ac.uk/talk/edit?list_id=86), which can
also be found in the navigation bar on the left of `talks@bham` once you are
logged in.

![The talks@bham navigation bar, with 'Add a new talk' circled](/images/seminars/adding.webp)

To make sure it doesn't get forgotten later, you should make sure the Zoom
details are added to the page; there's a sheet on the seminar organisation
spreadsheet which has a template you can copy.

### Solicit speaker suggestions

Send out an email to the Theory mailing list and put a message on the Discord
asking for people to suggest speakers.
As these drip in, you can add them to the *Speaker suggestions* sheet of the
seminar spreadsheet, which may already contain overflow speakers from previous
terms.

#### Who we should invite

Ideally, any potential speaker should be 'relatively' local: they should be able
to get to Birmingham by train in a few hours.
This is because we can *definitely* reimburse train travel in the UK.

If someone is from further away (e.g. Scotland) then they are likely to require
a hotel overnight.
This *is* possible and we have done it several times before, but be sure to
check this with Research Support at
[cs-researchsupport@contacts.bham.ac.uk](mailto:cs-researchsupport@contacts.bham.ac.uk)
before you invite anyone.

If a host has the funding to host someone from further afield for a couple of
days, they are of course welcome to do so!

### Advertise `talks@bham` functionality

It is good to periodically advertise the functionality `talks@bham` offers for
keeping up to date with the seminars.
Users can set up email reminders or add the list to their calendar.

![The top of a seminar list page on talks@bham, with 'Send me email reminders' and 'Subscribe using ical/vcal' circled](/images/seminars/reminders.webp)

Remember that `talks@bham` will only send emails to those with `bham.ac.uk`
email addresses!

## Arranging specific seminar slots

Now it is time to fill the individual seminar slots!
Of course, you can go about this however you like but I find the following
procedure works quite nicely.

### Negotiate with the host

When you have some speaker suggestions, send some emails to the prospective
hosts offering them *one* slot from the schedule.
If they can't do this one, keep offering until you are both satisfied.
This prevents the deadlock of having all the slots 'pending' with nobody
replying to you!

Make sure the host is aware of their responsibilities to not only *host* the
speaker but also to *chair* the talk.
It is also the responsibility of the speaker to organise a social event for the
speaker if one is desired, unless they ask you very nicely and you are feeling
benevolent.

### Make contact with the speaker

Once you are set on a slot, give the host the go-ahead to invite their speaker,
ideally with you in cc.
Speakers are more likely to respond to their friends and collaborators!
Make sure the host lets the speaker know we can reimburse their train travel,
meals on the day, and a hotel if appropriate, and that the seminar is
**50 minutes plus questions**.

Once this email has been sent, put the potential speaker on the spreadsheet
with the 'Offered' tag.

![A row of the theory seminar spreadsheet, filled in with 'George Kaye', 'University of Birmingham', 'g.j.kaye@pgr.bham.ac.uk', 'George' and 'Offered' highlighted in yellow](/images/seminars/offered.webp)

### Negotiate with the speaker

If all goes well, the potential speaker will reply quickly, and will be free for
their allocated slot!
If not, deallocate the current slot and choose another currently free one,
making sure both host and speaker can make it.
Eventually, you should find a slot that works.
Once everyone is happy, change the tag in the spreadsheet to the 'Confirmed'
tag.

![A row of the theory seminar spreadsheet, filled in with 'George Kaye', 'University of Birmingham', 'g.j.kaye@pgr.bham.ac.uk', 'George' and 'Confirmed' highlighted in green](/images/seminars/confirmed.webp)

### Add speaker to `talks@bham`

At this point you should add the speaker's details to the relevant page on
`talks@bham`, which you should have made earlier.
This can be done by clicking the 'Edit this talk' button at the top of the talk
page.

![The top of a talks page, with 'Edit this talk' circled](/images/seminars/editing.webp)

### Upgrade the talk to the departmental series *(optional)*

The CS department has a departmental seminar series, aptly named the Computer
Science Seminar Series; some of these talks are even toted as 'Distinguished
Seminars'.
More details can be found on the
[Computer Science Seminar Series `talks@bham` page](http://talks.bham.ac.uk/show/index/3137).
These seminars are usually followed by refreshments or a buffet lunch in the
atrium.

If a host feels that their speaker will appeal to a wider audience than just the
theory seminar, they can get in touch with the organisers to 'upgrade' the talk.
To do they can email Research Support at
[cs-researchsupport@contacts.bham.ac.uk](mailto:cs-researchsupport@contacts.bham.ac.uk),
ideally with you in cc to coordinate.
If the CS series organisers agree to host the seminar,
*responsibility of organising the seminar transfers to them unless otherwise specified*.
Make sure this is well-established!

I have previously received communication from the CS seminar organising
committee because they have become overwhelmed by requests for speakers in their
series, so they can't afford all the refreshments needed.
So make sure you ask politely :)

If a theory seminar talk is upgraded to a departmental seminar, it will
eventually appear on their `talks@bham` page.
You can then remove it from the theory seminar list and 'include' the version
from the departmental list, which can be done by clicking the appropriate button
at the top of the page.
This means we don't have two copies of the talk page floating around!

![The top of a `talks@bham` page, with 'Add to your list(s)' circled](/images/seminars/otherlist.webp)

### Book the speaker a hotel *(where appropriate)*

If the speaker will be staying overnight, it is cordial to book them a hotel
room so that they aren't as much out of pocket.
This can be done by sending an email to Research Support at
[cs-researchsupport@contacts.bham.ac.uk](mailto:cs-researchsupport@contacts.bham.ac.uk).
Research Support will contact the speaker to confirm their details and the hotel
room will be booked.

### Get title and abstract

The start of the week before the talk, you should make contact with the speaker
again for their title and abstract.
`talks@bham` sends out emails at `04:06` on Sunday giving information about talks
in the upcoming week, so ideally the full details of the talk will be in place
before then.
I also like to request the speaker sends across their slides, making it less
stressful to set up in advance, and to remind them that the seminar is 50
minutes plus questions.

You should cc in the host into this email and let the speaker know that the host
will be greeting and entertaining them once they arrive.
You can also subtly remind the host to bring the speaker to the room ten minutes
before the talk begins!

### Announce the talk

The week of the talk, you should announce the talk both on the theory mailing
list and on Discord. In the email you should include the title, abstract and
Zoom details; in the Discord message I tend just to link to the `talks@bham`
page to avoid cluttering the channel.

If you're interested, I have
[a script to generate the emails](https://github.com/georgejkaye/talks-bot).

### Set up seminar room

On the day of the seminar, your only job is to set up the room!

#### Seating

These days it's good to set up at least 25 seats since we're a large group now!
Depending on how the room is when you arrive it might be preferable for some of
the rows to also have tables, but that's up to you.

#### Zoom

You need to set up the computer in the room and join the theory seminar zoom
call.
I already have [a guide on how to set up LG23](https://georgejkaye.com/lg23)
which you might find useful since LG23 is a bit non-standard.
Other rooms in the university are a bit more straightforward.

Make sure the online participants (if there are any) can hear you!

#### Slides

You will also need to get the slides up on the screen.
Once they are, ensure that the speaker can actually change slides by flicking
through them a little.

#### Chairing

Once you are ready to go, the host can begin their chairing duties.
Even though you are now relinquished of responsibility, I find it's often good
to be sitting somewhere you can get to the front fairly easily in case there's
technical issues.

### Reimburse speaker

After the seminar, the last thing to do is to contact the speaker with details
on how to claim their expenses.
If they are being funded by another member of the group, you of course do not
need to worry about this.

The speaker will need to fill out the intimidating-looking
[non-staff expenses form](https://intranet.birmingham.ac.uk/finance/transaction-services/pay-you/expenses/non-staff-expenses.aspx).
Their expenses need to go in the top half of the form, i.e. *not* the section
labelled 'For project use only'.
The appropriate codes can be found in the seminar spreadsheet.
It is nice to pre-fill out a row to show the speaker how it is done.

![The first claims section of the non-staff expenses form, filled out with 'Trains - Cambridge to Birmingham' and 'Lunch at Staff House' along with some dummy values for 'Company', 'Analysis', 'Cost Centre', 'Activity', 'Source of Funds' and 'Amount'](/images/seminars/claim.webp)

Once the speaker has filled out the form, they should send it to Research
Support at
[cs-researchsupport@contacts.bham.ac.uk](mailto:cs-researchsupport@contacts.bham.ac.uk)
with you in cc, stating that they are claiming for the theory seminar.
With any luck, the claim will be processed quickly and the speaker will get
their money back in a few weeks.
(At the time of writing, Research Support are *very* efficient; this may have
changed by the time you are reading this!)

Note that payments are usually made on *Fridays*.
