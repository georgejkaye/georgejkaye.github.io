  abstract:
    We adapt the existing work on rewriting string diagrams using hypergraphs in order to apply it to settings with a traced comonoid structure, which happens to be where we model digital circuits.

  abstract:
    We model digital circuits with delay and feedback as morphisms in a symmetric traced monoidal category, formalise their semantics as stream functions with certain properties, and present equational theory for reasoning with them.
