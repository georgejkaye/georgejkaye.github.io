First you must take these two Class 323s to Longbridge as 5N04, and then drive the first northbound service of the day as 2P04. The lines will be very quiet on your way down to Longbridge, and even when things start to pick up on your way back there shouldn’t be too much traffic to deal with - have a good drive!"

  description: "Hello driver! Welcome aboard unit 150129, which is currently standing at a signal at Standish Jn, south of Gloucester. It’s a sweltering summer’s day, and you are being held here to allow a delayed CrossCountry service to pass. Today you are driving service 2G85, the 1336 from Swindon to Cheltenham Spa, on the leg between Standish Jn and Cheltenham Spa. You’ll be calling at Gloucester and Cheltenham Spa. One last thing to note is that there is a temporary speed restriction of 10mph over Barnwood Jn (which you will travel over as you leave Gloucester for Cheltenham) due to the heat causing the tracks to be in danger of buckling."
