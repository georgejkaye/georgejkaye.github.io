  description: "It’s a beautiful Sunday morning and you’ll be spending it driving up and down the Cross-City Line. First you must take these two Class 323s to Longbridge as 5N04, and then drive the first northbound service of the day as 2P04. The lines will be very quiet on your way down to Longbridge, and even when things start to pick up on your way back there shouldn’t be too much traffic to deal with - have a good drive!"
