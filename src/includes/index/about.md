## About me

My primary research interests are in graphical calculi for compositional systems and the lambda calculus using monoidal categories, and reasoning about these structures diagrammatically using *string diagrams* and *graph rewriting*.
I am also interested in programming languages and compilers, as well as making and experimenting with visualisers for various theoretical concepts.

Currently I am working on developing the *categorical semantics for digital circuits with delay and feedback* first presented by [Ghica and Jung](https://doi.org/10.4230/LIPIcs.CSL.2017.24) using [symmetric traced monoidal categories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traced_monoidal_category).
This gives us a *graphical calculas* with which we can reason about circuits *syntactically*.

When I'm not researching, I play the piano and go on adventures usually involving trains, canals or both.
I occasionally take photos of pretty things and put them on [Instagram]({{ links.instagram }}).
If you want something less pretty, here are some [pictures of me](/pictures)! 
I also use [Twitter]({{ links.twitter }}).
