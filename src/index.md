Hello! I’m George, a PhD student researcher at the University of Birmingham, under the supervision of [Dan Ghica]({{ people.dan.web }}) and [Miriam Backens]({{ people.miriam.web }}).
I am a member of the [University of Birmingham Theory Group]({{ links.theory }}), and helped run
the [weekly seminar](https://researchseminars.org/seminar/TheoryCSBham) from
March 2022 to March 2024.

I also used to work part time at the [Huawei Edinburgh Programming Languages Lab](https://blogs.ed.ac.uk/he-lab/).

## About me

My primary research interests are in graphical calculi for compositional systems and the lambda calculus using monoidal categories, and reasoning about these structures diagrammatically using [string diagrams](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.0908.3347).

I am currently writing up my PhD thesis on **a fully compositional theory of sequential digital circuits with delay and feedback**.
This project is based on work by [Ghica and Jung](https://doi.org/10.4230/LIPIcs.CSL.2017.24) who modelled digital circuits as
morphisms in a [symmetric traced monoidal category](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traced_monoidal_category).
My job was to tidy this all up and make it formal, leading to three sound and complete semantics for sequential circuits:
a **denotational** semantics of monotone stream functions, a reductions-based **operational semantics**, and
an **algebraic semantics**.
Using recent work on [string diagram graph rewriting](https://doi.org/10.1145/3502719), this gives us a framework suitable
for performing **graph rewriting** on digital circuits.

When I'm not researching, I play the piano and go on adventures usually involving trains, canals or both.
I occasionally take photos of pretty things and put them on [Instagram]({{ links.instagram }}).
If you want something less pretty, here are some [pictures of me](/pictures)!

You might want to read [my CV]({{ links.cv }}).

## Contributing

If you find a mistake, make an [issue](https://github.com/georgejkaye/georgejkaye.github.io/issues) and I'll try to sort it out.
Alternatively, you can figure out how my static site generator works and fix it yourself with a [pull request](https://github.com/georgejkaye/georgejkaye.github.io/pulls)!

I like doing little coding projects: here are some of them:

I've made some guides to impart the admin knowledge I've gained from four years
of doing things in the Birmingham theory group to help the next generation:
