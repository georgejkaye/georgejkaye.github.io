Hello! I’m George. Currently I work as a backend software developer as part of
the Insurance Products Integration Development team at
[Acturis Ltd](https://www.acturis.com/).

### The old times

From 2019 to 2024 I was a PhD student at the University of Birmingham, under the supervision of [Dan Ghica]({{ people.dan.web }}) and [Miriam Backens]({{ people.miriam.web }}), as a member of the [University of Birmingham Theory Group]({{ links.theory }}), I helped run the [weekly seminar](https://researchseminars.org/seminar/TheoryCSBham) from
March 2022 to March 2024 and also looked after the [group website](https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/research/activity/computer-science/theory-of-computation/people).

Between 2021 and 2024 I also used to work part time at the [Huawei Edinburgh Programming Languages Lab](https://blogs.ed.ac.uk/he-lab/).
