      <h2>Machines at the front</h2>
      <p>
        There are <em>two</em> computers at the front of LG23: the 'zoom
        computer' controlled by the touch screen terminal, and the more
        conventional computer with the mouse and keyboard. As far as I know,
        there's no way to cast from conventional computer to the big screen, but
        the big screen can be mirrored on the monitor on the podium by changing
        the source of the latter. (I believe the computer is DisplayPort and the
        big screen is HDMI, but I could be mistaken.)
      </p>
      <h2>Connecting the room to the zoom</h2>
      <p>
        First make sure the big television screen is on (it often already is).
      </p>
      <p>
        <img
          src="/images/lg23/screen-controls.jpg"
          alt="Controls for the screen in LG23: the 'Display &gt; ON' button is illuminated."
        />
      </p>
      <p>
        If it's not on, try pressing the 'ON' button on the control panel to see
        if that shocks the screen into life. If this isn't successful, don't
        panic: try pressing the power button on the bottom of the screen, and
        make sure the screen is powered on (the plug is directly beneath it).
      </p>
      <p>
        If the screen is on, it should show a nice picture of Chancellor's
        Court. If it just says 'no signal', this means that someone's messed
        around with it; there should be an HDMI cable behind the screen that
        connects the bottom HDMI port to the underside of a box on the wall,
        which should have some flashing ethernet lights on it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once you're satisfied that everything is good, start by pressing 'Join'
        on the zoom terminal:
      </p>
      <p>
        <img
          src="/images/lg23/join-call.jpg"
          alt="The initial screen of the zoom terminal: there are three buttons for 'New meeting, 'Join' and 'Share Content."
        />
      </p>
      <p>
        <img
          src="/images/lg23/join-meeting.jpg"
          alt="The zoom terminal with the 'Join meeting' dialog opened, the meeting ID box is active."
        />
      </p>
      <p>
        If you press the down arrow by the 'Meeting ID' box you can usually find
        the 'Theory Lab Lunch and Seminar' meeting in the list, to save you
        having to type it in manually. If it's not there for whatever reason,
        the meeting id is <em>818 7333 5084</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <img
          src="/images/lg23/previous-meetings.jpg"
          alt="The drop down list of previous meetings, with the 'Theory Lab Lunch and Seminar' option visible."
        />
      </p>
      <p>You will then be prompted for the password, which is <em>217</em>.</p>
      <p><img src="/images/lg23/password.jpg" alt="The password prompt." /></p>
      <p>
        You will then be in the meeting! If you turned on the big screen, the
        room camera's picture should now be visible on it. You can use the
        'Camera control' option on the zoom terminal to adjust the picture if
        it's at a weird angle or zoom.
      </p>
      <p>
        <img
          src="/images/lg23/controls-camera.jpg"
          alt="The zoom terminal shows the meeting controls, with 'Camera control' circled."
        />
      </p>
      <p>
        If the room is quite talkative while people filter in before the
        seminar, it may be a good idea to go on mute. Don't forget to unmute
        when the talk starts!
      </p>
      <h2>Setting up the speaker</h2>
      <p>
        There are two options: the speaker can either use their own laptop or
        the conventional computer to present. If using the latter, you'll need
        to log on using your university credentials. The process is otherwise
        the same for both: connect to the zoom call using the above details and
        then the speaker can screenshare.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now you can make sure the speaker is screen sharing correctly and that
        they can change slides and so on. Once this is done, the 'speaker
        thumbnail' in the corner of the screen needs to be disabled, as it can
        get in the way of the slides for the physical participants. To do this,
        select 'View' from the meeting controls:
      </p>
      <p>
        <img
          src="/images/lg23/controls-view.jpg"
          alt="The zoom terminal shows the meeting controls, with 'View' circled."
        />
      </p>
      <p>Make sure 'Speaker' is selected, then tap on 'Layout Options':</p>
      <p>
        <img
          src="/images/lg23/view-options.jpg"
          alt="The 'View' panel, with 'Speaker' and 'Layout Options' circled."
        />
      </p>
      <p>Now select 'Off' to banish the speaker thumbnail altogether!</p>
      <p>
        <img
          src="/images/lg23/thumbnail-position.jpg"
          alt="The 'Layout Options' panel, with 'Off' circled."
        />
      </p>
      <p>
        If you need to access the participants, for example to spotlight the
        speaker or mute someone, this can be done through the zoom terminal
        directly.
      </p>
