# CrossCountry to the Coast

![CrossCountry to the Coast](/images/scenarios/crosscountry-to-the-coast.jpg) 

* **Traction:** Class 390 Pendolino
* **TOC:** Virgin Trains Cross Country
* **Route:** Riviera Line Electrified
* **Duration:** 40 mins
* **Difficulty:** Medium

Today you are driving the 1V41 0642 Birmingham New Street to Paignton Virgin CrossCountry service, for the last leg from Exeter St Davids to Paignton. Traction is in the form of a Class 390 Pendolino. It is a lovely spring morning so it should be a good drive! You will be stopping at Newton Abbot, Torquay and finally Paignton.

This scenario uses the lovely Riviera Line Electrified by joethefish! I decided to go along with his story, so the CrossCountry franchise is now owned by Virgin again, who use Pendolinos across their network. GWR continue to operate the Greater Western franchise, and now operate a 4tph stopping service between Paignton and Exmouth (using the Class 365), in addition to 2tph fast services between Penzance and Paddington (using the Class 800). Freight operations are handled by DRS, who use their extensive fleet of Class 68s across the country.

Have fun!

* **TOC:** Great Western Railway
* **Route:** Riviera Line Electrified
* **Duration:** 65 mins

Although the age is diesel is but a distant memory, the Intercity 125 'High Speed Train' is still fondly regarded by many railway enthusiasts. Fortunately, GWR have arranged a special railtour using one of their old HSTs and have chosen you to have the honour of driving this very special journey! You will be calling at Exeter St Davids, Dawlish, Teignmouth, Newton Abbot, Torquay and Paignton. 

This scenario uses the lovely Riviera Line Electrified by joethefish! I decided to go along with his story, so the CrossCountry franchise is now owned by Virgin again, who use Pendolinos across their network.
