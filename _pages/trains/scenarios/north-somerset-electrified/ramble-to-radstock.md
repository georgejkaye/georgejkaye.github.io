When the North Somerset Railway proved very popular with local residents, GWR opted to start regular passenger services along the line. Today you'll be driving a fast service from Westbury to Radstock, calling at Frome Market and Mells Road along the way. Since you're a fast service you shouldn't be held up too much so enjoy this beautiful spring morning!

This is a fun fictional scenario using the North Somerset Railway Electrified line that imagines what it would be like if GWR decided to actually use the North Somerset Railway for passenger services. They operate fast services from Westbury to Radstock (like the one you'll be driving) and slower stopper ones using specially modified three car Class 387s (reclassed as 387/9s).

Have fun!
