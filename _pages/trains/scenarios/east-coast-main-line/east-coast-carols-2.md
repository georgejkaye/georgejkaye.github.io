Hello driver! Welcome back aboard the 1S23 1530 London Kings Cross to Glasgow Central service. Allow passengers to board ready for departure at 16:16. On this leg, call at Newark North Gate (16:43/16:44), Doncaster (17:08/17:10), and York (17:31/17:36). The snow is still falling so be careful!

It’s Christmas! So here’s a present for the festive season: a multipart scenario up the East Coast Main Line all the way to Scotland! I am a big fan of Christmas liveries and the wordplay in ‘Claus 91’ is simply too good to resist.

I would strongly recommend reducing your graphics settings for this scenario, as there are places that are quite intensive and the game may crash!
