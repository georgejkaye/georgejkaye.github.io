![Theorem Prover](/images/projects/theorem-prover.jpg)
A simple theorem prover that uses resolution to prove or disprove theorems in a variety of formats (such as a set of expressions and a conclusion, or the widely used DIMACS format), using propositional resolution or the Davis–Putnam–Logemann–Loveland (DPLL) algorithm.

Made for a university programming assignment.
