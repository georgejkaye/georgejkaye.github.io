[![Theorem Prover](/images/projects/theorem-prover-thumb.jpg)](#theorem-prover) [![Ballin'](/images/projects/ballin-thumb.jpg)](#ballin)

## [Theorem Prover](https://github.com/georgejkaye/theorem-prover)
![Theorem Prover](/images/projects/theorem-prover.jpg)
Made for a university programming assignment, a simple theorem prover that uses resolution to prove or disprove theorems in a variety of formats (such as a set of expressions and a conclusion, or the widely used DIMACS format), using propositional resolution or the Davis–Putnam–Logemann–Loveland (DPLL) algorithm.

## [Ballin'](https://github.com/georgejkaye/ballin-game)
![Theorem Prover](/images/projects/ballin.jpg)
A game made in a team of six for a university team project, where the players are encased in glass balls and must knock foes off the arena! I worked on the graphics and graphical style of the game, establishing its simple 'retro' aesthetic and the map tile system.
