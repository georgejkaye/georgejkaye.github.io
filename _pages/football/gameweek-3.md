### *Wiltshire Wanderers 42 - 32 Bilbo Baggies*
----------------------------------

**A missed Romelu Lukaku penalty and good games for Zanka and Rashford contrived to award the Wanderers their first victory of the season in a hugely exciting and nail-biting Selly Oak Derby.**

The Wanderers entered the week with heavy hearts, having lost both their previous games and sitting at the bottom of all of their leagues with a disappointing score of 64. The Baggies also wanted the win, hoping to bounce back from their agonisingly close defeat in Gameweek 2. This was the first time the derby had been played in the top flight, and tensions were high amongst both fans and players. George Kaye, Wanderers manager, had been under intense pressure throughout the week to resign, and responded defiantly by replacing veteran defender Nacho Monreal with relative newbie Zanka. Fans voiced their discontent at their manager with banners calling for his exit, and while not all those fears will have been quashed this week, it is a positive sign of things to come.

## Day one: A stroke of luck

From the get-go, it seemed the Wanderers were doomed to repeat the failures of the previous weeks, with Vincent Kompany failing to maintain a clean sheet and picking up another yellow card in the process. Having missed the opportunity to gain valuable points against the Baggies, fans began to grow restless.

Several crucial moments soon followed, with Rashford, Matic, Mata and Zanka all in play, along with the Baggies' captain, Romelu Lukaku. Lukaku had been a key player for the Baggies, leading them to a stunning victory in Gameweek 1, and performing well in Gameweek 2 despite his team's loss. It seemed that he might again prove to be their talisman when he stepped up to the penalty spot, a huge amount of points in the balance. But Lukaku missed his penalty, and the Wanderers were further boosted by a Rashford goal shortly after he came off the bench. While Matic and Mata both had average games, a clean sheet by Zanka brought the score to 18-2, with Lukaku receiving a shock 0 points.

At this point, it seemed inevitable that the Wanderers were on the way to their first league victory, with several strong players and their captain, Harry Kane, still left to play. Rob Pol, manager of the Baggies, contemplated that his team might be facing 'destruction by Kaye's Wanderers'. Kaye himself was somewhat more subdued, his philosophy of 'comeback's always on' holding back his excitement.

## Day two: Baggies bounce back

The early games proved somewhat negligible to the scoreline, with low scores awarded to Zouma for the Wanderers and Hegazi and Phillips for the Baggies, after none managed to keep a clean sheet. The main event was the two later games. This was an opportunity for the Wanderers to boost their lead, with a potentially easy game for Kane, and opportunities for Xhaka and Lacazette to pierce a previously weak Liverpool defence.

Instead the Wanderers capitulated, with Lacazette and Xhaka both receiving 1 point after their drubbing at Anfield, and Kane failing to show his potential, receiving only 2 points. Meanwhile, the Baggies were hoping to stage a comeback, with Mané performing extremely well and looking hungry for more goals. Fortunately for the Wanderers, he was substituted before he could cause any more damage.

Although the Baggies still threatened towards the end of the game, with the Wanderers showing no signs of improvement, the final whistle blew with the scoreline 42-32. Kaye was visibly relieved, having spent the last parts of the game on the edge of the pitch, encouraging his players. The two managers warmly shook hands and exchanged banter before retiring inside the Arley. It is known that Pol and Kaye are friends off the pitch, and this exciting derby will not have soured their relationship.

## Reaction
While the win will be a huge boost to the Wanderers' and Kaye's morale, the second day exposed the flaws in the team. Had Lukaku not missed his penalty we could be telling a very different story. Kaye will need to work more on his team if he is going to seriously contend for any respectable position in the league. However, his willingness to drop his favourite player shows signs of a great manager within, and the risk paid off this week. To ensure his team does not fall back into obscurity next week we need to see more of this managerial flair.

## What's next?
The Wanderers will attempt to add a second win to their collection against Medakovic's Ospina Colada: the only team to have lost every game so far, while the Baggies host Carrington's DC Kievs at home in a bid to end their run of poor form.
