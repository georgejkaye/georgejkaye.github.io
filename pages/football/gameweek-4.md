### *Ospina Colada 46 - 44 Wiltshire Wanderers*
----------------------------------

**The Wanderers missed a chance to gain another three points, despite a return to form for Kane, as their poor defense gave Ospina Colada their first win of the season.**

Buoyed by their shock victory in Gameweek 3, the Wanderers travelled to Ospina Colada with a spring in their step, hoping to add another win to their collection. Colada sat at the bottom of the table with three straight losses, and manager George Kaye sensed a chance to gain more points. Due to Kompany's injury, unused defender Adam Smith was exchanged for Hegazi, who had shown promise in previous weeks. Unfortunately the defensive trio of Zanka, Hegazi and Morgan proved ineffective and Ospina Colada exploited this to pip the Farmfooders to the post, winning by just two points.

## Day one: A return to form

Despite his poor performance in Gameweek 3, Kaye elected to award to captaincy to Lacazette this week, hoping for a strong game against Bournemouth. This prediction turned true as Lacazette scored in a 3-0 thumping, gaining seven points, although Xhaka was mostly anonymous during the game and only picked up three points. What was truly astonishing was Kane's performance. Norb Sports pundits had suggested that September might prove to be 'Kane season', and the Spurs striker clearly agreed, scoring two goals and eventually ending up with thirteen points (after bonus points). While happy with Kane's performance, it was clear to see the anguish he had over the potential points he had lost by not captaining Kane.

Mata, Matic, Morgan and Rashford were also playing on the first day. While Rashford managed to score again, returning seven points, the three M's failed to make an impact and returned a combined total of four points. Even more disappointingly, Hegazi had a very bad game and conceded three goals, leading to him being awarded zero points. 

Despite these setbacks the Wanderers ended the day with a commanding total of 44 points, compared to the Colada's 36. This was the highest ever return for the Wanderers, but Ospina Colada still had several players left to contribute to their point total, compared to just Zanka for the Wanderers.

## Day two: Levelling it out

The Wanderers had a rest on the second day, while Ospina Colada added to their point total with a strong performance from Lowton. Crucially, this brought the scores level at 44-44. Both teams had only one player remaining: Zanka for the Wanderers and Chicharito for the Colada. 

## Day three: One versus one

All eyes were focused on the final game of the week. Kaye was hoping for a clean sheet from Zanka to cancel out any points from Chicharito, while one goal would effectively end his chances of victory. With Zanka's strong defense over the past three weeks it was not an impossible situation.

Zanka failed to achieve this clean sheet however, and picked up a yellow card in the process, becoming the second defender in the team to end the week on zero points. Chicharito did not score but his two points for playing were enough to grant Ospina Colada their first victory. The loss for the Wanderers means that they slump back to the bottom of the table, having experienced the joy of 15th for just one week.

## Reaction
While a dream second victory was not to be today, the Wanderers still managed to accrue more points than the past three weeks, and outperformed several big teams this week too. The defense was simply unlucky this week, and with the return of Kompany hopefully soon, Gameweek 5 could prove to be an even more successful week.

## What's next?
The Wanderers are travelling again to tenth-placed Tekkaslovakia, while Ospina Colada are also away to Bony & Clyde. Both teams are hoping to gain a second win and move up the table further.

## Local teams
* The **Bilbo Baggies** suffered a third defeat in a row to DC Kievs, losing 34-41.
* **Kadaras in Pyjamas** also lost, despite scoring 52 points in an exciting 69-52 game.
* Morris' **Bilbao Baggins** were another team who performed well with 50 points but still lost 60-50.
