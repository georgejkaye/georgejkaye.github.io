Hello! I'm George, a PhD student researcher at the University of Birmingham, under the supervision of [Dan Ghica](https://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~drg/) and [Miriam Backens](https://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~backensm/)!

I am a member of the [Theory Group](https://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/groupings/theory/).

### Contact me

**University:** g.j.kaye at cs.bham.ac.uk

**Where to find me:** Office 244 (Desk J), School of Computer Science, University of Birmingham

## About me

My primary research interests are in graphical calculi for compositional systems and the lambda calculus using monoidal categories, and reasoning about these structures diagrammatically and by using graph rewriting techniques. I am also interested in general programming languages and compilers. On a more practical side, I enjoy making and experimenting with visualisers for various theoretical concepts.

Currently I am working on a diagrammatic semantics for digital circuits, motivated by the work of Ghica and Jung \[[1](https://doi.org/10.1109/FMCAD.2016.7886659)\] \[[2](https://doi.org/10.4230/LIPIcs.CSL.2017.24)\]. I am using a variant of [hypergraphs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypergraphs) that are a sound and complete calculus for symmetric traced monoidal categories. The ultimate aim of this project is to define an automatic rewriting system for these hypergraphs that we can use as an effective and *efficient* operational semantics for digital circuits.

When I'm not researching, I play the piano and go on adventures usually involving trains, canals or both. I occasionally take photos of pretty things and put them on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/georgejkaye/). If you want something less pretty, here are some [pictures](/pictures) of me! I also (very rarely) use [Twitter](https://twitter.com/thegeorgejkaye).

I'm currently School of Computer Science [Cookie Break](https://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/internal/research_students/cookiebreaks/) admin! The Cookie Break is the School's longest running social event and it's an honour to be in charge of such an esteemed tradition.
