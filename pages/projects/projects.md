## Visualiser for λ-terms as rooted maps

![Visualiser for λ-terms as rooted maps](/images/projects/visualiser.png){: class="project-img" }

My MSci final year project: a set of tools to help investigation of terms from various fragments of the λ-calculus. The core function of the tools is to represent these λ-terms as rooted maps.

## Theorem Prover

![Theorem Prover](/images/projects/theorem-prover.jpg){: class="project-img" }

Made for a university programming assignment, a simple theorem prover that uses resolution to prove or disprove theorems in a variety of formats (such as a set of expressions and a conclusion, or the widely used DIMACS format), using propositional resolution or the Davis–Putnam–Logemann–Loveland (DPLL) algorithm.

## Multiplayer Arena Game

![Multiplayer Arena Game](/images/projects/ballin.jpg){: class="project-img" }

A game made in a team of six for a university team project, where the players are encased in glass balls and must knock foes off the arena! I worked on the graphics and graphical style of the game, establishing its simple 'retro' aesthetic and the map tile system.

## Named Entity Recognition Tagger

![Named Entity Recognition Tagger](/images/projects/ner-tagger.jpg){: class="project-img" }

An assignment for a Natural Language Processing module, this tagger parses tagged training texts along with other data (titles, names etc) and attempts to classify names, places and organisations in new test data. Also uses Wikipedia to try and correctly classify the named entities.
