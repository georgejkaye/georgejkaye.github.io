Hello driver! Welcome aboard unit 158960, which is currently standing at Frome. Today you’ll be driving 2M12, the 1410 service from Frome to Swindon, calling at Westbury, Trowbridge, Melksham, Chippenham, and Swindon.

Unfortunately, you’ve been pathed behind a late-running freight train from Whatley Quarry, so you may be chasing yellows until Westbury! It also looks like there’s some disruption on the GWML, so be prepared for delays!

In Part 1, you’ll drive between Frome and Bradford Jn, calling at Frome, Westbury and Trowbridge. In Part 2, you’ll drive between Thingley Jn and Swindon, calling at Chippenham and Swindon.
