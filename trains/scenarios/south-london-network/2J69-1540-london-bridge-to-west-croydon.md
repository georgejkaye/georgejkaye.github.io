Hello driver! Today you are driving the 2J69 1540 London Bridge to West Croydon Southern service. As always the lines are busy but you should have no problems today! Prepare your cab and allow passengers on board for departure at 15:40. You will be calling at South Bermondsey, Queens Road Peckham, Peckham Rye, East Dulwich, North Dulwich, Tulse Hill, Streatham, Streatham Common, Norbury, Thornton Heath, Selhurst and West Croydon.

I've always enjoyed driving the Class 455/8, so here it is in my first attempt at a busy scenario! Hopefully you should see plenty of traffic in either direction. Set in 2017, so Gatwick Express are now using 387s, Thameslink have replaced First Capital Connect, and Southern have ditched all their Class 456s. The timetable is based on the current working timetable.

I would **strongly recommend** reducing your graphics settings for this scenario, as there are places (especially the start at London Bridge) that are extremely intensive and the game may crash!
