Iâ€™ve used the original Class 450 (from the original Portsmouth Direct Line) and Class 444 in an attempt to reduce lag and increase frames! It can still get pretty choppy between Waterloo and Clapham Junction though, so you may want to turn your graphics settings down.

Requirements marked with an asterisk (*) feature fairly fleetingly and can be omitted without loss of enjoyment. 

If you don't have any of the requirements you can still play the scenario, just press F2 when the 'Missing consist' error comes up and click 'cancel' to bypass it.
