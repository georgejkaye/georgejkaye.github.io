Hello driver! Your final task of the day is to drive the 1A15 Gatwick Express service to London Victoria, leaving Brighton at 19:48. You will be calling at Gatwick Airport and London Victoria only. Watch out though, as the weather is positively foul and could impede your progress towards the capital. We are also receiving reports that the train ahead of us has been experiencing engine troubles. Allow passengers to board and set up your cab ready for departure at 19:48!

Another busy scenario ending up in south London, but not everything may go to plan! Set in 2017, so Gatwick Express are now using 387s, Thameslink have replaced First Capital Connect, and Southern have ditched all their Class 456s. The timetable is based on the current working timetable.

I would **strongly recommend** reducing your graphics settings for this scenario, as there are places that are extremely intensive and the game may crash!
