Hello driver! Today you are taking 1V06 from Birmingham New Street all the way to Cardiff Central. Set up the cab and let the passengers on board, ready for departure at 10:30 sharp. Then call at University (10:36/10:37), Cheltenham Spa (11:10/11:11), Gloucester (11:20/11:25), Chepstow (11:50/11:51), Newport (12:10/12:12) and finally Cardiff Central (12:26). There are no delays reported but we have had word that some signals are on the blink, so you may have to request permission to pass them! Otherwise enjoy the ride!

This journey is one I tend to make every year on a trip to Cardiff (getting on at University), so I thought I might recreate it on the very well-made Birmingham â€“ Bristol XC Route. This was also a chance to whip out the new AP Turbostar enhancement pack which I picked up in the recent sales.
