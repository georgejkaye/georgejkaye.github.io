Hello driver! Today you are behind the controls of 2G85, a First Great Western stopping service from Swindon bound for Cheltenham Spa. Currently you are waiting at a signal at Standish Jn, south of Gloucester, waiting for a delayed CrossCountry service to pass. Ensure your cab is ready so that you can depart immediately once you are given the road: hopefully you should be on time again once you depart Gloucester! One last thing to note is that there is a temporary speed restriction of 10mph over Barnwood Jn (which you will travel over as you leave Gloucester for Cheltenham) due to the heat causing the tracks to be in danger of buckling. Drive safely!
