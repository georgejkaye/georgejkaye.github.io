Hello driver! Christmas has finally arrived and Virgin Trains East Coast have brought back the ‘Claus 91’ for the 1S23 1530 London Kings Cross to Glasgow Central service! Allow passengers to board and set up the cab ready for departure at 15:30. On this leg you will be calling at Peterborough (16:15/16:17) only. Although snow has started to fall, everything still seems to be in order and hopefully you won’t experience any problems on your drive north!

It’s Christmas! So here’s a present for the festive season: a multipart scenario up the East Coast Main Line all the way to Scotland! I am a big fan of Christmas liveries and the wordplay in ‘Claus 91’ is simply too good to resist.

I would strongly recommend reducing your graphics settings for this scenario, as there are places (such as Kings Cross) that are quite intensive and the game may crash!
