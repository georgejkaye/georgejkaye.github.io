### *Ospina Colada 46 - 75 Wiltshire Wanderers*
### *Tekkaslovakia 79 - 96 Wiltshire Wanderers*
----------------------------------

**The Wanderers bring their year to a close with two scintillating performances, putting them in a good position for the new year.**

Back at the start of December, things were not looking rosy for the Wanderers or their manager George Kaye. They accrued just 26 points in Gameweek 15, almost their lowest ever return. Tensions were high at the Arley and pundits were speculating Kaye's imminent expulsion from the historic team. The team was lounging in the bottom of the table, having picked up a disappointing number of wins in their campaign.

## The Wildcard

Kaye did not appear perturbed in his pre-Gameweek 16 press conference. He announced the use of his first Wildcard of the season, exchanging club veterans such as Zanka, Xhaka and Monreal for FPL superstars like Sterling and Salah. Kaye turned to a striking duo of Kane and Lacazette (supplemented by Watford striker Gray) and chose to fill his midfield and defence with talent in order to boost his chances.

The results were marked, if not exceptional. Despite a red card for Zeegelaar and an injury to Sakho, Gameweek 16 saw a return of 47 points, a total that would have been stunning at the start of the season. But it wasn't enough for Kaye, as the Wanderers still lost the match 47-61. Critics started whispering of a forced, unnecessary Wildcard for publicity. Kaye remained tight-lipped and suggested his detractors wait and see.

Gameweek 17 provided a win for the Wanderers, who beat the Kim Jong-un XI 32-45. Strangely, Kolasinac did not play and was substituted for Hegazi, who provided an unexpected clean sheet to the team.

## The Selly Oak Derby

Gameweek 18 saw the second Selly Oak Derby of the season, and Kaye was determined to keep his 100% record (having won the last derby in Gameweek 3). He brought in Tarkowski to boost his dodgy defense, and the Burnley man delivered, providing a clean sheet. Once again Kolasinac did not play, disappointing Kaye. Despite high scores from Salah and Sterling, the Baggies edged to victory 58-51 in a highly entertaining game.

## A Christmas Miracle

The shock loss against Ospina Colada earlier in the season still haunted the team, and Kaye promised to make amends. The team did so in remarkable style, with trusty midfielders Salah and Sterling providing double figures, and Kane returning a remarkable 17 points as the Wanderers romped to victory 46-75.

Kaye did not stop there. Having grown tired of Kolasinac's failure to play, he transferred in Otamendi on a whim, noting the player's surprisingly low price. He also decided to switch to a 3-5-2 formation, as Gray had failed to impress in recent weeks. It was a genius tactic. Kane once again returned 17 points, and this week Kaye had decided to captain him. The devastating midfield trio of Young, Salah and Sterling provided a combined 31 points, and Otamendi brought back an impressive 8 points. Although the week itself had a high average of 62 points, the Wanderers smashed this with 96 points, beating Tekkaslovakia 79-96.

This Wanderers record led to Kaye's team bringing home the most points in all of their leagues. The astonishing performace was congratulated by several of Kaye's managerial friends. It is now up to Kaye to build on this performance and continue to challenge for the mid-table positions, rather than the bottom as was the case earlier in the season.
